Course structure
   
   
   
  Each year of the BSc programme is designed around a combination of compulsory core modules, as well as opportunities to take optional modules so you can choose additional subjects of interest. The balance of compulsory to core modules depends upon the year and programme of study and is explained fully in the programme catalogue.  
  If you opt to study abroad or to join our year in industry scheme you will pursue this at the end of Year 2, returning to your final year of study once completed.

The processes which govern such cycles are fundamental to all life, and result in a complex series of interactions and feedbacks. This module takes an Earth System Science approach to the study of the global cycling of biologically important elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. You will learn about the processes governing the movement of these elements, and how to represent them using simple box models and address questions such as:

          GEOG3180: Management of Wilderness and Global Ecosystems
          
           What are wildernesses and why should we protect them?
           How is the idea of wilderness linked to the rise of the 'environmental movement'?

           How can GIS be used to identify, map and manage wilderness landscapes?
           What is rewilding and why should we create more wilderness?
           How does wilderness feature in world conservation policy?
          
          GEOG3440: Environment, Conflict and Policy
          
           What are the key principles underlying policies aimed at solving environmental conflicts?
           What is the fundamental science underlying the application of these key principles?
           How do actual environmental disputes develop and how can contrasting viewpoints of different stakeholders be reconciled?
           When does the politics of policy sometimes override science?
           How can negotiation skills be used in practise to manage debates on environmental conflict?
          
          GEOG3520: Workplace Co-operative Project 
          This module is mutually exclusive with GEOG3820: Research Placement. The module provides students with an opportunity to:
          
           Work in collaboration with an outside organisation on a project that is of use to the organisation and suitable as an advanced component of a degree in Geography.
           Design, negotiate, record and manage their work in cooperation with an academic supervisor and a member of staff from the outside organisation.
          
          GEOG3690: Tropical forests and sustainable development
          
           How resilient have tropical rain forests been to environmental change during geological history?
           What is the role of glacial ‘refugia’ in shaping current tropical rain forest communities?
           How have indigenous people affected tropical rain forests landscapes?
           What factors control the diversity of tropical rain forests?
           How do tropical rain forests affect the climate system? 
           Is sustainable development possible in SE Asia?
           What constraints on economic and social development are imposed by the fragile natural environments of SE Asia?
           How do national-governmental and international policies affect land-use in SE Asia?
           In a land-use context, what is meant by 'good governance'?
           What are the causes of land-use change in SE Asia and what is the relationship between land-use change and social and economic development? 
          
          GEOG3710: Digital worlds: computer simulation of Earth's dynamic environments
          
           What is an environmental model and why do scientists and environmental managers use models?
           How can models be both wrong and useful?
           How are models constructed?
           How are models tested and used both by practitioners (e.g., policy makers) and scientists?
           What is a numerical experiment and what can it tell us about an environmental system?
          
          GEOG3820: Research Placement 
          This module is mutually exclusive with GEOG3012: New Zealand Research Project and GEOG3520: Workplace Co-operative Project. In this module students undertake a substantial piece of original research on a project put forward by an academic supervisor. Often, the project will be an important part of a wider research programme of the supervisor. Students will be expected to contribute to the design of the project and will gain an in-depth appreciation of how academics ‘do’ research. The module is useful for those considering a career in research through study for a higher degree (MSc or PhD).  
          GEOG3875: Biogeochemical Cycles: Process to Policy  
          Global biogeochemical cycles describe the movement of biologically important elements through the Earth System (the combination of atmosphere, oceans, rocks and biota). The processes which govern such cycles are fundamental to all life, and result in a complex series of interactions and feedbacks. This module takes an Earth System Science approach to the study of the global cycling of biologically important elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous. You will learn about the processes governing the movement of these elements, and how to represent them using simple box models and address questions such as:
          
           How do biogeochemical cycles combine to control Earth evolution, regulation, and climate?
           How have humans impacted biogeochemical cycles, and what are the future implications of this?
          
          GEOG3885: Ecosystems of the Quaternary 
          With a focus on the Quaternary period of Earth’s history (the last 2.6 million years), this module uses a palaeoecological approach to address the following questions:
          
           How have modern ecosystems come into being?
           How do plants and animals respond biogeographically to climate change?
           What effect have Quaternary climate cycles had on the evolution of species and communities?
           How can we apply this knowledge to managing the ecological consequences of human impact on the environment?
