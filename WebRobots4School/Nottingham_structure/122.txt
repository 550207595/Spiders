  Semester 1 modules (taken at University of Birmingham)  
  • Maths, Physics and Electrical Principles • Study Skills • Kinematics of Transportation • Railway Traction Systems • Energy Conversion Systems  
  Semester 2 modules (taken at University of Nottingham)  
  • Advances Power Conversion • Advanced AC Drives • Power Systems for Aerospace • Technologies for the Hydrogen Transport Economy  • Advanced Electrical Machines  
  Semester 3 (taken at University of Nottingham)  
  • Research project  
  The taught element takes place between September and May and consists of lectures, seminars, tutorials and workshops. The individual project takes place in industry or at The University of Nottingham, between May and August.   
  Research project  
  The research project is taken at the university at which the student is registered and cannot be changed. It is important, therefore to consider the research topic likely to be studied.  Typical projects at Birmingham include:  
  
   Railway Power Systems  
   Railway Traction Systems  
   Grid Connected Charging Systems  
   Hydrogen Hybrid Systems   
  
  Typical projects at Nottingham include: Marine Electrical Propulsion, Aircraft Power Systems, Advanced Electric Drives for Propulsion
