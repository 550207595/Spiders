   Professional Geographical Information Science: Consultancy Project 
  
  
   This module involves students conducting group projects on GIS-related topics for a real-world client. There are three main objectives:  
   
    students gain valuable experience of working on GIS projects in a real-world environment. That is, these projects are of genuine interest and relevance to the client, rather than being academic exercises   
    students develop useful skills through working as part of a team.   
    the client gains from useful feasibility studies.   
   
   In essence, these projects are similar to short-duration, real-world consultancy projects. The taught part of the module is designed to help students focus on the conceptual, technical and managerial issues relating to the projects. Generally this module is student-led.   
   Groups are expected to arrange their own meetings, manage the division of workload and ensure they are meeting the requirements of the client (but also exploring further possibilities that the client may not have considered).  
   This module aims to:  
   
    teach students to think and perform research independently  
    engage students in real group-based consulting activity with an outside client
