   Maritime Security Law 
  
  
   With the codification and development of the international law of the sea during the 20th Century, coastal state maritime security has gained in prominence as an array of maritime zones have been proclaimed, and new sovereign rights and expanded jurisdiction asserted over maritime areas.   
   Alongside this development there has been, since the adoption of the United Nations Charter in 1945, an increasing maritime security dimension to the concerns and response of the Security Council, especially when acting under Chapter VII. The numerous Security Council Resolutions which have mandated naval operations, and more generally military operations to maintain international peace and security, provide clear evidence of this factor.  
   UN mandated naval operations were especially significant in the sanctions regime imposed against Iraq (1990 - 2003) during which time extensive state practice developed in this field. Since then, the Security Council has also mandated member states to conduct military operations at sea to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and piracy.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    facilitate understanding and knowledge, at an advanced level, of the nature and function of maritime security law
