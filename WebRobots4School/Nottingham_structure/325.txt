Modules  
    
  This course comprises five taught modules:  
  
   Cell, Developmental and Molecular Biology  
   Embryonic Stem Cells  
   Adult and Foetal Stem Cells  
   Research Skills and Stem Cell Technology Exploitation  
   Translational Technologies for Stem Cells   
  
  and a research project:  
  
   Regenerative Medicine Research Project  
  
  Summer projects offer real experience.  During the summer semester, you will undertake a three-month, 60-credit research project and produce a dissertation.  From May to August all our students work on real projects that are aligned with academics working at the cutting edge of research.  
  
   Project Options  
  
  
   Each year, our students have a choice of around 21 different projects. We've listed a few of the titles below to give you an idea of what might be available.
