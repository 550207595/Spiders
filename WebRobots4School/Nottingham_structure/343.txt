Modules  
  You will take four modules, each counting for 30 credits: Texts, Methods, Themes, Debates and write a 7,000 piece of coursework for each module. While the course is taught in small seminar groups on topics from the pathway that you choose (see the Course Details), for your essay you will choose one of the four modules: Texts, Methods, Themes, or Debates. For example, someone studying Dante might choose to look at debates about how negative his theology might be; another might concentrate on close analysis of one particular text; a student might explore the theme of penitence; another might explore the methodological implications of studying religious ideas through a literary text. Across the degree, each of the modules will be covered.  
  A student following a Philosophical Theology Pathway might write a methods coursework essay on Phenomenology, a debates essay on Justice, explore some theme in 20th century theology, and analyse one of the primary texts in the Continental Philosophy of Religion seminar. There is therefore coherence in research skills but considerable choice among the topics of study.  
  With the permission of the Course Co-ordinator, you may substitute one of the four modules with 30 credits of modules at undergraduate level, from another department or from our own extensive range of MA distance learning modules.
