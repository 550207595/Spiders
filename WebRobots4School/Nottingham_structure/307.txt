   Dissertation for MA in Research Methods (Social Policy) 
  
  
   Students will be expected to work under supervision on a project of their choice related to their subject area.  
   Students' research work will be supported by their allocated supervisor, graduate school courses and the taught modules offered earlier in the programme.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    allow students to identify a researchable question, develop a research proposal, carry out a literature review and conduct pilot work  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Foundations in Qualitative Methods 
  
  
   This module provides a conceptual overview of the various approaches and debates associated with theory and practice of qualitative research. It examines a range of contrasting perspectives on the design of research including problem identification, selection and sampling, and analysis.  
   Research ethics, and the role of the researcher in generating qualitative data, are key themes which run through the module. Specific consideration is given to the ways in which qualitative and quantitative approaches may be seen as complementary, and the use of mixed methods.   
   The module will also cover the ways in which qualitative research can be evaluated.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students the necessary theoretical underpinnings to plan, conduct and evaluate qualitative research  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Investigating Social Policy 
  
  
  
    The module will examine the flow of policy making, from inception to implementation.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The first part of the module will explore various theories of policy making at different levels and will take the form of a seminar with previous set readings. The latter part of the module will be related to recent or current research undertaken by central or local government in the UK, or Europe, though examples may also come from other countries.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     allow students to identify the explanatory, empirical and conceptual means of understanding the context and content of policy initiatives, and to undertake a detailed case study of their choice

   Contemporary Issues and Debates in Social Work 
  
  
   This module examines the nature of contemporary debates and issues in social work by focusing on the nature of knowledge in social work and some of the main social theories which conceptualise social work and its relationship to the state, society and the individual.  
   Students will be enabled to understand how different theoretical approaches provide different ways of thinking about the nature of social work in advanced modern societies and their implications for social work practice.   
   The debates covered will include:  
   
    how to protect children and vulnerable adults  
    personalisation and adult care  
    the role of research in social work and evidence-based practice  
    reflexivity  
    structure/agency, power and inequalities  
    risk and the bureaucratisation of social work  
   
   This module aims to:  
   
    allow students to understand the key debates in theory and practice, and how different theoretical perspectives seek to explain and define what social work is  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Criminology in Practice 
  
  
   This module offers students the opportunity to spend some time with an organisation working in a field related to crime, victimisation or criminal justice (a ‘criminal justice organisation’).  
   The organisation may be in the public, private or third sectors and students will be able to get a sense of the way in which the issues they have encountered in their academic studies are experienced and addressed in practice. In some cases they may also be able to contribute in a practical way to the work of the organisation.   
   The academic element of the module focuses on encouraging students to reflect on their experiences observing and contributing to the work of the organisation with which they have spent time in the light of a relevant body of criminological literature and what they have learnt in other contexts.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    enable students to experience at first hand, and reflect critically on, the work of organisations in fields related to crime, victimisation and criminal justice and to make appropriate use of the knowledge, understanding and skills they have gained through studying criminology

    Human Rights and Critical Modern Slavery 
   
   
    This module critically interrogates dominant liberal discourse on human rights and modern slavery.  
    Drawing on academic, popular and policy debate on human rights and case studies of phenomena that are deemed to constitute contemporary human enslavement - such as human trafficking, prostitution, domestic servitude, worst forms of child labour, forced labour and bonded labour in a number of sectors and regions - the module offers an opportunity to critically deconstruct the theoretical and political assumptions that underpin this discourse.   
    The module ultimately aims to draw students’ attention to the deep connections between human rights and social, economic and political inequality on the basis of gender, class, race, sexuality, age and other identity markers under contemporary conditions of globalisation.  
    This module aims to:  
    
     provide students with advanced level sociological knowledge of the concepts of human rights, globalisation, and modern slavery, an appreciation of the connections between these, and a critical understanding of their application in a range of discourses  
     equip students with knowledge and understanding of the relationship between policy concern with modern slavery and processes of globalisation  
     make students aware of how the changing cultural and political landscape can affect some groups’ ability to access human rights  
     facilitate an understanding of sociological debate and theory on concepts of globalisation, human rights, and modern slavery and their intersection with debate and theory in other disciplines  
    
   
  
      
   
  
    Leadership, Strategy and Performance in the Public Section

    Public Management and Governance 
   
   
    This module will cover models of management and governance in the public sector.   
    It will critically examine comparative and historic trends in managerial practices and theory and contextually relevant ideas about management and governance in the public sector, including specific professional contexts.  
    This will include critically exploring specific debates about the alleged move from public administration to new public management and new public governance, from hierarchical to networked and marketised forms of organisation, and those involving communities in the design and delivery of public services.  
    This module aims to:  
    
     equip students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills to analyse varieties of governance and management practices in the public sphere  
     examine a number of key management issues in public sector organisations  
     examine specific professional contexts, and allow students to draw on their own professional experience to illustrate multi-professional approaches to governance and management  
    
   
  
      
   
  
  Optional modules  
  
  Students need to choose 4 x 10 credit advanced training modules from the following list:
   
  
  
    
  
 
   Archival Methods 
  
  
  
    Informed by insights from other disciplinary contexts, this module will explore how and why the archive as a research site might similarly be of interest to qualitative sociologists and investigate how archival documents can be used in research.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The module will therefore both offer an introduction to archive theory and a hands-on introduction to working with a variety of archival documents. The module will consider the following issues: 
   
   
   
    
     how might we define the status and purpose of the archive and its contents?  
     how does the archive’s status and purpose influence our mode of engagement with it?  
     what are the politics of the archive? What ‘traces’ are present, what missing, with what gendered, ‘raced’, classed etc. results?  
     how have historians and others worked with and within the archive, given these limitations?  
     what are the advantages and limitations in ‘re-using’ qualitative archived data?  
     approaches to interpreting archival documents  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      problematise the meaning and status of the archive and its contents  
      understand the ways in which archival documents might be used in sociological research  
      acquire knowledge of the appropriate theoretical and methodological tools to critically analyse a range of archival documents  
      understand different approaches to interpreting a range of documents in the archival context  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Doing Ethnography 
  
  
  
    This module considers in detail 'ethnography' as a qualitative research method.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It explores the underlying principles and practices of the approach, which, broadly speaking, involves studying people 'at first hand', in detail, usually at length and in the context in which they live, work, play etc. It will explore: 
   
   
   
    
     key concepts and approaches  
     important ethnographic studies  
     critiques, strengths and weaknesses  
     designing and planning your own ethnographic study  
     students will experience a range of learning methods including lectures, workshops, film viewings, student presentations and group work  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     give students knowledge of the practical and theoretical underpinnings of the ethnographic method  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Individual and Group Interviews 
  
  
  
    This block will involve practically-oriented sessions, to explore a variety of individual and group interview approaches. This will include focus groups as well as structured, semi-structured, and more open-ended styles of interviewing (including narrative approaches). It will also consider the use of stimulus material, vignettes, and critical incidents as possible ways of structuring interview interactions. 
   
   
    
   
  
    Sessions will include practical demonstrations of interviewing, and will involve the analysis of interview transcripts, along with published research papers, which use different analytical approaches.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Among a range of issues that will be considered, it will discuss some of the ethical issues that can arise when this type of fieldwork is being conducted, and there will be plenty of opportunity for group members to draw upon their own research experiences within this and other discussions.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      give students practical, hands-on experience in using different qualitative approaches to the individual and group interviews, and think through some of the methodological and epistemological issues that it gives rise to  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Researching Media, Culture and Society 
  
  
  
    This module will offer a masterclass in key debates and issues in the Anglo-American media in order to explore a range of theories about popular media and different approaches to studying a range of media genres. It problematises the role of the media in contemporary culture and society in two specific contexts:  
   
   
   
    
     gender and identity   
     science and society   
    
   
  
    The gender and identity block will explore feminist theories about popular media, with the emphasis on exploring research methods and methodologies appropriate for analysing gendered mediated representations as they intersect with other axes of difference such as race, class and sexuality. 
   
   
    
   
  
    science and society aims to engage students with the way that the media frame issues through culturally situated language and images, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these ways of framing, steering and stimulating public debate about science and technology.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      problematise the role of the media in contemporary culture and society, using the case studies of ‘gender and identity’, ‘science and society’ and ‘culture and citizenship’  
      acquire knowledge of the appropriate theoretical and methodological tools to critically analyse a range of media texts  
      understand the ways in which media representations are classed, racialised and sexualised as well as gendered  
      understand the ideological, professional, cultural and technological factors governing the practices of the mass media  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Researching Public Policy and Management 
  
  
  
    This module covers some of the main approaches to researching public policy and public management.

     comparative research (in particular cross-country research)  
     researching networks and governance arrangements  
     use of performance indicators  
     elite interviewing and the evaluation of policies and cost-benefit analysis  
    
   
  
    The module will also use case studies to illustrate the designs, methodologies and methods discussed. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to:
