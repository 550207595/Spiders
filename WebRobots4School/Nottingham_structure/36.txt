Modules  
  Critical Approaches to Art History and Visual Culture (Autumn semester) explores a range of theoretical issues relating to the study of art history and visual culture. The module helps prepare students for the philosophical questions we need to address in order to undertake a historical analysis of images.  
  Criticism and Display (Spring semester) examines key issues relating to both curatorial and critical practices in the visual arts. In addition to classes examining the history of criticism and display, students have the opportunity to develop exhibition ideas and critical writing skills in response to gallery visits and sessions led by curators.  
  Optional modules include:  
  
   Landscape, Space and Place  
   Image and Identity  
   Visualising Conflict  
   Art and Spectatorship  
  
  In preparation for researching and writing a 15,000-word dissertation, students undertake a series of focused workshops to support their project throughout its development, from defining a research topic through to planning and writing the dissertation. Each student will be assigned an academic supervisor who will advise on the development of their project in a series of individual tutorials.
