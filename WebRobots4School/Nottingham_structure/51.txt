  Taught modules  
  This one-year full-time course consists of taught modules (120 credits), followed by a brewing research project (60 credits) in which you will use skills and knowledge gained during the taught modules to devise and undertake an innovative piece of research. Typically, projects will be conducted in partnership with the brewing industry and provide opportunities for work experience.  
  The core of the course is delivered in two modules which are delivered face-to-face as lectures, seminars and practical classes throughout the year:  
  Fundamentals of Brewing (20 credits) – module information to be added soon  
  Practical Brewing (10 credits) – module information to be added soon  
 
   The programme starts with an introduction to the brewing process, its historical development and the range of beer styles which comprise the modern beer market. You will be taught the practical, technical and engineering know-how required of a professional brewer in the modern industry. Substantial emphasis is placed on the development of practical brewing skills and your ability to brew your own beer to specified style guidelines, using our pilot brewing facilities. 
  
  
   
  
 
   The remaining modules are studied via a combination of e-learning materials and intensive short courses (which are held throughout January and May): 
  
  
   
  
  Raw Materials for Brewing  (20 credits)  
  Brewhouse Processes  (10 credits)  
  Brewery Yeast Management  (10 credits)  
  Fermentation and Yeast Handling  (10 credits)  
  Beer Maturation  (10 credits)  
  Packaging of Beer (10 credits)  
  Brewing Microbiology  (10 credits)  
  Beer Analysis and Quality Management  (10 credits)  
  You will study these modules alongside students on our world-renowned MSc Brewing Science, which provides continuing professional development for brewers already employed in the industry. This part of the course firstly follows the stages of brewing production from raw materials to beer in pack, providing in-depth technical knowledge underpinning each step. Subsequently you will focus on beer quality, specification and the necessary standards and in-process checks required to manufacture beers that are ‘right first time’.
