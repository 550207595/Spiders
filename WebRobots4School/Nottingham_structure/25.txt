Modules  
  The course is taught through modules on Moodle and uses virtual discussion groups and tutorials, self directed study, self managed learning groups tasks and coursework.  
  Moodle is a virtual  learning environment - an online electronic course management system that supports and extends communication between students and staff. It is accessed through the University website.  
  There are six modules in the course, two of which are research based. Each module has a value of 30 credits and represents 300 hours of study, including formal teaching, independent study, revision and the preparation of assessments.  
  The modules are:  
  
   Ergonomics Applications in the Workplace  
   Ergonomics Methods  
   Human Factors in Interactive Systems  
   Ergonomics in Work Organisations  
   Human Factors in Context  
  
  For more details on our modules, please see the Module Catalogue.  
  Each module is offered over a 26-week span, normally once a year, with module start times in September and March.  
  Usually you will study three modules in one 12 month period. The average student will therefore gain their MSc qualification in three years. In special circumstances it may be possible to study either one module at a given time or three modules concurrently.  
  UK students will need to attend the University during your first year of study for one exam. Overseas students can make arrangements to take the exam in their home country.
