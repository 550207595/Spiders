This is the current module information. Modules may change, subject to the University's programme approval, monitoring and review procedures. 
 This module is provided as part of this interdisciplinary Framework within the Faculty of Health Studies. The Framework enables students to create an individualised programme of study that will meet either their needs and/or the employersâ€™ needs for a changing diverse workforce within a modern organisation. 
 The modules and academic awards are presented in areas representing employment practice or work based or clinical disciplines. 
 Whilst some students can build their own academic awards by choosing their own menu of module options, other students will opt for a named academic award. The Framework also provides the option for students to move from their chosen named award to another award if their job or personal circumstances change and they need to alter the focus of their studies. The majority of named awards also offer students, the option of choosing at least one module, sometimes more, from across the Faculty module catalogue enabling them to shape their award more specifically to their needs.
