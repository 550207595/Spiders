Program Structure
A Master of Philosophy (Surgery) comprises an independent, supervised research project mutually agreed upon by the student, their supervisors and Head of School. Domestic students can choose to undertake the degree by either 100% research or, by mixed research and coursework; international students will normally proceed to the degree by mixed research and coursework.
The award of the degree for students in the 100% research stream is based entirely on the examination of a thesis, however, students in the mixed research and coursework stream complete one third of the degree (15 units) by coursework and the remaining two thirds of the degree by research resulting in the production of a proportionally smaller thesis.
International students in the mixed research and coursework stream undertake 3 core courses (comprising the Integrated Bridging Program - Research) as follows:
EDUC 7054 Research Design (3 units)
EDUC 7055 Research Communication (3 units)
EDUC 7058 Research Processes (3 units)
All other coursework for both domestic and international students can be selected, in consultation with supervisors, from amongst relevant Master by Coursework or Honours level courses offered by the University.
As you progress through the degree, you will complete a number of key milestones which will assist both yourself and the University to assess your progress and ensure that you are on track to complete in a timely manner.
Examiners of a Master of Philosophy (Surgery) thesis seek evidence that the candidate has:
a thorough understanding of the relevant techniques and methodologies in the field as demonstrated by a thorough critical review of the literature
demonstrated competence in the chosen field through judicious selection and application of appropriate methodology to yield meaningful results
demonstrated the capacity to evaluate critically these results
