Modules  
  The modules we offer are inspired by the research interests of our staff and as a result, may change from year to year. The following list is therefore subject to change but should give you a flavour of the modules we offer.  
  
   Typical Year One Modules  
  
  
   You share the same core modules as BA English, and are introduced to prose, poetry and drama and performance from the medieval period to the modern day, and to aspects of English language from the beginnings of English to applied linguistics.  
   While some of these areas may be familiar to you, others may be quite new, and our aim is to support you as much as possible as you encounter fresh ways of approaching and thinking about the study of English.  
   Alongside these modules, you will take the Academic Community module, taught in small tutorial groups, to introduce key issues to English and to develop your study skills as you make the transition from school or college to university.  
   You are also able to take module options in creative writing or in subsidiary modules, offered by the School and by other departments in the Faculty of Arts and across the University.

     This module, taught through a combination of practical workshops, seminars, and lectures, considers key concepts in the study of dramatic texts, theatre history and performance. The module frames these concepts, taking into consideration questions about who performs, where, to whom, why and how, through explorations of key moments in the Western theatrical tradition.

    Creative Writing Practice 
   
   
   
     The first-year module, Creative Writing Practice, acts as a foundation, focusing on the process of writing fiction, drama and poetry, through various forms of reading, writing and performance practice. You will be encouraged to experiment with techniques and strategies, such as character, dialogue and imagery, to create new work. You will also develop the capacity to reflect on this work in a disciplined and rigorous fashion – an essential skill in creative writing. Creative Writing Practice puts special emphasis on the real-life processes of published writers, including research, collaboration, publication and performance, and how it feels to be interviewed about your writing. 
    
    
   
  
      
   
  
    Regional Writers 
   
  
    In this module you’ll look at the work of selected regional writers, including Nottingham writers such as D.H Lawrence, considering how their work engages in regional landscapes, the literary heritage of the area, and other distinctive cultural elements such as dialect.

Writers produced texts about contemporary issues such as class, poverty, sexuality, slavery, and the city, but also had their eyes firmly on the past. They took every available opportunity to promote their own agendas and to savage and ridicule those of their political and literary opponents.
