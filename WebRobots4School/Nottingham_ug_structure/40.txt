   Typical Year Four Modules  
  
  
  
    Research Presentation Skills 
   
   
    This module offers an introduction to the skills required in a modern scientific career. Through a series of lectures, you will become familiar with the best practice in oral, written and internet-based communication skills. This will be supplemented by tutorials, in which you will discuss recent key papers with peers, and write for a lay audience. Workshops will give you the opportunity to produce materials such as a web-page and poster. This module consists of one 2-hour lecture each week, and a series of single 6-hour workshops over six weeks.  
   
  
      
   
  
    Research Project 
   
   
    The project is a year-long module. Preparatory work (literature review and familiarisation with laboratory/field safety protocols etc.) occurs in autumn, with the bulk of the practical work in spring. Youâ€™ll choose the topic of your project from a list of suggestions relevant to your degree subject and will finalise this after consultation with your supervisor. The project involves an extensive piece of detailed research. Reading and collating earlier research by other scientists working in the area is an essential component. Youâ€™ll use your literature review to write a research grant proposal, which outlines the hypotheses to be tested, the proposed experimental design and the research costs associated with the project. The practical component involves collection of data from a laboratory or field investigation and appropriate analysis. Your findings will be interpreted in the context of previous work, and written up in a clear and concise final report in the form of a research paper.  
   
  
      
   
  
    Cutting Edge Research Ideas in Molecular Biology 
   
   
    This module will bring you up to date with the latest technological developments in molecular biology that you are unlikely to have encountered in detail in your first three years. We also discuss and explore how new technologies with broad implications come into existence and follow the process of establishment, acceptance and dissemination through the scientific community. This module involves having a three hour workshop each week.   
   
  
      
   
  
    Advanced Experimental Design and Analysis 
   
   
    This is an advanced level biological statistics module, building on basic undergraduate (Levels 1 and 2) training. Lectures discuss concepts in experimental design, biological probability, generalised linear modelling and multivariate statistics. Practical sessions build on this conceptual outline, giving you hands-on experience of problem solving and analytical software, and some basic programming skills. You'll spend around three hours per week in lectures and workshops studying this module.  
   
  
      
   
  
    Process and Practice in Science
