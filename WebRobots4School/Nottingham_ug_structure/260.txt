  This is a combined honours course, meaning it has three components. All three components have equal weighting in the degree.   
  This course enables you to combine the study of two European languages to final degree level with a range of non-linguistic and business studies modules.   
  Languages offered as part of this course are: French (post-A level only); Portuguese, German, Russian, Spanish (all beginners or post-A level); and Slovene, Serbian/Croatian, Dutch (beginners only).

  The modules we offer are inspired by the research interests of our staff and as a result, may change from year to year. The following list is therefore subject to change but should give you a flavour of the modules we offer.
