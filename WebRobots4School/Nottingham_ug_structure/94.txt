  Core modules  
 
   Introduction to Macroeconomics 
  
  
  
    This is a single semester introductory course in macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate economy, focusing on the cyclical pattern of aggregate output and co-movement of real and monetary aggregates in general equilibrium. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This course introduces a series of basic models used in modern macroeconomics, with a particular focus on dynamic general equilibrium modeling tools and techniques necessary to build theoretical models. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a sound basis in the fundamentals of macroeconomics and their application to both theoretical and real world situations  
     develop analytical skills using the major methods of mathematics and diagrams  
     engender the ability to communicate and report findings, particularly via tutorial essays, presentations and exercises  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Introduction to Microeconomics 
  
  
  
    Introduction to microeconomics, including behaviour of firms and households in situations of competitive and imperfectly competitive markets. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a sound basis in the fundamentals of micro-economics and their application to both theoretical and real world situations  
     develop analytical skills using the major methods of mathematics and diagrams  
     engender the ability to communicate and report findings, particularly via tutorial essays, presentations and exercises  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Introductory Econometrics 
  
  
  
    Econometrics has been described as ‘’the point where economic theory confronts reality’’. Besides the comparison of economic theoretical predictions with actual outcomes, this analysis allows quantitative flesh to be put on theoretical bones. Since the subject is essentially data analytical, econometrics relies heavily on statistical methods. Of course the study of econometrics requires a firm basis in the fundamental principles of statistical methodology. 
   
   
    
   
  
    The purpose of this module is to introduce some of these principles, so that its subject matter is basic statistical inference rather than econometrics proper. That subject matter has been applied in many branches of the sciences, social sciences and humanities. Here we concentrate on statistical distribution theory and statistical inference in the first half of the course. The second half deals with the linear regression model, whose extensions will be analysed in detail in subsequent econometrics modules. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a sound basis in statistical theory, appropriate to the subsequent study of econometrics  
     introduce the principles of regression analysis, on which much of the subsequent study of econometrics is based  
     induce familiarity with these basic concepts to ease the understanding of material in the second and third years of the course  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Mathematical Economics 
  
  
  
    The module is intended to provide an introduction to mathematical techniques used in economics. In particular, examples of economic issues that can be analysed using mathematical models will be discussed in detail. 
   
  
    Particular attention will be given to providing an intuitive understanding of the logic behind the formal results presented. Students who wish to pursue a higher degree in economics will find the module particularly useful. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a rigorous grounding in certain mathematical tools and methods of argumentation used in microeconomic theory  
     develop a clear perception of the role of mathematical tools and logical methods in the construction of the formal theory of individual decision-making  
     develop the ability to analyse economic problems through rigorous applications of the formal theory of individual decision-making  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Writing Economics 
  
  
  
    This module aims to introduce students to the essential skills required for writing as an economist. It will be delivered in conjunction with Libraries, Research and Learning Resources (LRLR), who will cover content on key information skills relating to the library and learning resources. 
   
   
    
   
  
    The module will centre around economic approaches to analysing human behaviour and provide a guide to good economics writing. It will give an introduction to the language of economics and basic research skills. Among the topics covered will be: 
   
   
   
    
     academic integrity and plagiarism  
     time management  
     writing essays  
     writing quantitative projects  
     presentation skills  
     referencing and using the internet  
     revision and examinations  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     introduce students to the issues and methods underpinning effective study at the Nottingham School of Economics  
     highlight the resources that are available at the University and how to access them  
     highlight the practical techniques to get the most out of study time  
     indicate good essay technique  
     highlight how to perform well in examinations  
    
   
  
 
     
  
  
  Optional modules  
 
   Current Economic Issues 
  
  
  
    This module focuses on a range of current issues facing the world economy, seeks to illustrate how economists model such issues, and examines potential policy responses.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Example topics to be covered are: 
   
   
   
    
     Globalisation  
     Economic growth  
     The global financial crisis  
     The world economy  
     Emerging economic superpowers  
     Consequences of rising economic nationalism  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     examine critically a number of current economic challenges facing the UK and the world economy  
     use economic analysis to investigate and clarify the underlying drivers of these challenges  
     identify potential gainers and losers and the role of economic policy in maximising the net benefits/minimizing the net costs  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Economic Perspectives 
  
  
  
    This module is intended as a foundation for the understanding of modern economic theories and policies. It is concerned with: 
   
   
   
    
     The different characters and workings of economies of the past  
     The changing ways in which economic questions have been interpreted and answered over time  
    
   
  
    As will be discovered, the 21st century Western views of everyday economic concepts such as ownership, money, exchange, work, poverty, industrialisation, economic growth and government are quite different from those expressed at other times and in other places. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     explore some key ideas and concepts of economics, both historically and culturally  
     explore both similarities and differences in solutions to economic problems, as adopted within different economic systems  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Growth and Development in Long-Run Historical Perspective 
  
  
  
    In this module, we will explore the long-run, historical determinants of the wealth of nations. We will begin by taking a long-run view on modern economic growth, showing how this has led to dramatic changes in the relative wealth of nations over the last 500 years. 
   
   
    
   
  
    We will then ask two key questions: why have modern economic growth started in some places rather than others? And while have some countries been able to catch up, while others have not? These investigations will improve our understanding of why are some countries much richer than others, and will give us some important insights on how to promote sustained growth in developing countries. 
   
   
    
   
  
    The module draws on a vibrant new literature in economics that looks at comparative development as the outcome of a long historical process, and uses techniques originally developed in economics to improve our understanding of history.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     introduce students to the key questions of comparative development, the main recent findings, and future challenges  
     create a foundation knowledge allowing students to put current issues in growth and development in historical perspective  
     highlight the role of modern economics in understanding history  
     suggest students a set of applications for theoretical and empirical methods in economics

   Econometrics I 
  
  
  
    This module generalises and builds upon the econometric techniques covered in the Year I module, Introductory Econometrics. This will involve introducing a number of new statistical and econometric concepts, together with some further development of the methodology that was introduced in Year I. The multivariate linear regression model will again provide our main framework for analysis. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide the necessary mathematical and statistical tools needed to conduct theoretical econometric analysis at an advanced level  
     develop the analytical skills required to demonstrate the theoretical properties of different econometric estimation and testing procedures under various modelling assumptions  
     provide a sound understanding of the applicability and limitations of the multivariate linear regression model as a vehicle for econometric analysis for economic data  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Econometrics II 
  
  
  
    This module introduces students to a range of statistical techniques that can be used to analyse the characteristics of univariate economic time series. The basic theoretical properties of time series models are discussed and we consider methods for fitting and checking the adequacy of empirical time series models. Methods of forecasting future values of economic time series are then considered. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide the necessary background techniques needed to analyse the behaviour of time series processes  
     develop the analytical skills required to characterize the theoretical properties of different time series processes  
     provide a sound understanding of the applicability and limitations of the univariate time series methodology as a means for empirical modelling and producing forecasts of economic time series  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Macroeconomic Theory 
  
  
  
    This module will address both the fundamental and applied aspects of macroeconomic theory. 
   
   
    
   
  
    In particular, the module will focus on: 
   
   
   
    
     Introducing the modern theory of expectations and economic dynamics  
     Using this approach to think about short run fluctuations  
     Studying the role of macro policy on short run fluctuations  
    
   
  
    The module will review the so-called modern approach to aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This entails incorporating into the classical approach to aggregate supply and aggregate demand insights from Keynesian economics. This will serve as a base to discuss the role of macro-policy in controlling for fluctuations in output and employment. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     introduce the students to the main issues and developments of modern macroeconomics.  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Microeconomic Theory 
  
  
  
    Intermediate microeconomics including general equilibrium analysis, welfare economics, elementary game theory, and strategic behaviour of firms. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     build upon the microeconomics you encountered in year 1  
     develop analytical skills by employing standard diagrammatic analysis and reference to the underlying mathematical techniques

  Core modules  
 
   Advanced Time Series Econometrics 
  
  
  
    This module is a continuation of the module on time series analysis taken in the second semester of the second year. While the earlier module was devoted to basic time series model building methodology, applicable over a broad range of disciplines, the present module concentrates on those developments which can be applied in the subject of Economics. 
   
   
    
   
  
    In particular, the emphasis will be on aspects of the behaviour of typical economic time series, and the implications of that behaviour in practical analysis, such as the construction of models linking economic time series. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     introduce the concept of unit autogressive roots, and the consequences of that concept for the analysis of economic time series - in particular, the importance of cointegration analysis and error-correction models  
     introduce other time series - analytic concepts and tools that have found applicability in Economics
