   The students will also explore the spatial unevenness of globalisation, and develop understandings of the ways in which globalisation has contributed to an increasingly unequal and differentiated society at a variety of scales. Alternatives to globalisation will also be discussed, focusing upon various counter-globalisation strategies in the forms of localism, activism and protest.  
   Throughout the module, staff will draw upon their own research as well as the wider academic literature, giving students a sense of the complexity, and importance, of globalisation as a set of theories and a set of sited realities.

   Each student will be assigned to a small tutorial group for the semester and will participate in tutorials with a different member of staff. Specific topics will be chosen by staff members based on their own, active, research programs and will reflect the leading research questions and problems in the discipline. Students will be supplied with a set of readings prior to each tutorial. Students will also be required to research the background context of the readings.  
   This module will expose students to the breadth and depth of research undertaken in geography. The module aims to develop a critical appreciation of contemporary research problems in geography and introduce students to alternative approaches to geographical research.

   This module further develops themes of river processes and dynamics introduced in module F82164 and considers them within the context of human attempts to manage and restore rivers. It initially centres on changes in the fluvial system that occur in response to river management and engineering and then goes on to examine approaches to restoring the natural functions of rivers that have been heavily degraded by human impacts.  
   The module includes reviews of past and present river channel restoration and rehabilitation activity in Europe and the USA. It details principles by which rehabilitation practice is guided, and introduces criteria for selection between rehabilitation strategies.  
   The module includes a residential field trip in semester one and a non-residential field trip in semester two, where students will have the opportunity to explore a range of river management and restoration issues relevant to rivers in the UK and develop practical skills in field survey and modelling techniques employed in contemporary river management.  
   The module aims for students to:  
   
    Appreciate recent developments in conservation-orientated river management  
    Stress the importance of retaining the physical integrity of river systems as the appropriate basis for sustainable river management  
    Raise awareness of the range, type and methods of river rehabilitation  
    Develop knowledge and critical evaluative skills to propose a rehabilitation design appropriate to a field-based example
