   Approaches to Politics and International Relations 
  
  
  
    The module introduces students to alternative theoretical approaches to the study of political phenomena.  
   
   
    
   
  
    We consider the different forms of analysing, explaining, and understanding politics associated with approaches such as: 
   
   
    
    
     behaviouralism  
     rational choice theory  
     institutionalism  
     Marxism  
     feminism  
     interpretive theory   
     post-modernism  
    
   
  
    The module shows that the different approaches are based upon contrasting ‘ontological’ suppositions about the nature of politics, and they invoke alternative ‘epistemological’ assumptions about how we acquire valid knowledge of politics and international relations.  
   
   
    
   
  
    We examine questions such as:  
   
   
    
    
     what constitutes valid knowledge in political science and international relations?   
     should political science methodology be the same as the methods employed in the natural sciences?   
     can we give causal explanations of social and political phenomena?   
     can we ever be objective in our analysis?   
     what is the relationship between knowledge and power?

Focusing on Japan, China and Korea, it will be possible to identify characteristic features of East Asian business systems, the internationalisation of various types of business systems and the trajectories of interaction between East Asian and north Atlantic businesses.  
   This module is aimed principally at assessing the interactions between East Asian Business and the global economy. Building on the first semester module that outlines the evolution of East Asian business systems, this module will contextualise these developments and link them with recent trends associated with globalisation.  
   Students will become familiar with the nature of East Asian business, how East Asian economies have fared over the last 20 years, and the influence of 'collective management' practices on European and American business and organisations. They will also be able to judge the extent to which convergence has become a major force in world business over the last 20 years.  
  
 
     
  
 
   Social Change and Public Policy in China's Reform Era

In the first part of the module participants will be sensitized about the interplay between socio-economic transformation, administrative reform and public policy making during China's reform era (1978-). Students will gain a deeper understanding how new government functions contribute to innovations in public sector management.  
   Drawing both on primary and secondary sources students will familiarise themselves with the increasingly lively domestic debates among social and political scientists, educators, media professionals, civil society practitioners, government officials and lawyers about goals and means of China's modernisation drive. In the second part of the module students will learn about the expanded spaces for participatory policy making in China by analysing case studies in all five substantive policy fields.  
   Students will be enabled to acquire the necessary theoretical and practical skills to analyse public policies in China. They will be encouraged to think critically about policy models and contrast them with evolving practices of public policy making in China.  
   Participants will gain a better understanding of the scale of social change in China, learn about the value of participatory policy making, and through small and big group deliberations and action will internalise a culture of collaboration by developing group presentations on selected public policies.
