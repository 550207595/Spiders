   Approaches to politics and international relations 
  
  
  
    The module introduces students to alternative theoretical approaches to the study of political phenomena.  
   
   
    
   
  
    We consider the different forms of analysing, explaining, and understanding politics associated with approaches such as: 
   
   
    
    
     behaviouralism  
     rational choice theory  
     institutionalism  
     Marxism  
     feminism  
     interpretive theory   
     post-modernism  
    
   
  
    The module shows that the different approaches are based upon contrasting ‘ontological’ suppositions about the nature of politics, and they invoke alternative ‘epistemological’ assumptions about how we acquire valid knowledge of politics and international relations.  
   
   
    
   
  
    We examine questions such as:  
   
   
    
    
     what constitutes valid knowledge in political science and international relations?   
     should political science methodology be the same as the methods employed in the natural sciences?   
     can we give causal explanations of social and political phenomena?   
     can we ever be objective in our analysis?   
     what is the relationship between knowledge and power?   
    
   
  
 
     
  
  
  Or  
 
   Designing Political Research 
  
  
  
    This module will help students to understand some of the key methods used by professional researchers who work in the areas of politics and international relations.

   Civilisation and Barbarism 
  
  
  
    This module explores some of the major themes in the study of International Relations.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Themes include: 
   
   
    
    
     Power and order   
     strategy

     barbarism  
     terrorism  
     torture  
     human rights  
    
   
  
    The course is distinctive in two respects: 
   
   
    
    
     First - the study of these themes each week takes its bearings from a significant text, and that text in its entirety  
     Second - the emphasis is on the interplay between the form and style of these texts and the ideas they contain  
    
   
  
    Students read all sorts of texts – novels, reportage, essays, a manifesto, a treatise, perhaps even a film – to investigate the political and ethical dimensions of the work.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     familiarise students with modern international relations texts that have become building-blocks of the literature, the schools of thought they belong to and/or have given rise to, and key themes and debates in the field  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Democracy and its Critics 
  
  
  
    Democracy is a contested concept and organising principle of politics both ancient and modern. Its appeal seems to be universal, yet it has always had its critics.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This module investigates the nature of democratic principles, the arguments of democracy’s opponents and the claims of those who say that contemporary life is inadequately democratised. A particular feature of the module is the use of primary sources to investigate historic and contemporary debates.   
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     provide an ability to assess the core constitutive ideas of democracy in its many manifestations   
     give an understanding of the case made against democracy by its various opponents   
     give an understanding of the appeal of democracy, but also why its establishment can be problematic    
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Global Security 
  
  
  
    This module explores issues in global security since the end of the Cold War. It focuses on security in a broad sense, from issues relating to the use of force by states, through to violence by non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, and on to the concept of human security.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The module builds on the first year modules 'Understanding Global Politics' and 'Problems in Global Politics', challenging students to deepen their theoretical as well as empirical knowledge in international security.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It is also a preparation for the research-led third year modules that require a much more developed capacity of analysing empirical developments from a range of different theoretical perspectives.   
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     introduce students to different theoretical approaches in global security  
     facilitate an understanding of the empirical development of global security since the end of the Cold War  
     investigate the breadth of issues within the field of global security

   Social and Global Justice 
  
  
  
    'Justice' has been one of the key themes of political theory at least from the time of Plato, as questions of who gets what, when, and why are absolutely central to political discourse.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Recently, questions of distributive and social justice have taken on a global dimension. Does the developed world have obligations to distant others, and do they have rights against it?  
   
   
    
   
  
    This module will look at these questions from a contemporary perspective, looking at ideas about justice from thinkers such as the utilitarians, John Rawls, Thomas Pogge, Susan Moller Okin, and Bhikhu Parekh.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     introduce students to core concepts in political philosophy/history of political thought, especially the concepts of justice and equality  
     encourage students to think analytically about the meaning of these concepts and the extent to which it depends upon historical circumstances  
     encourage students to think about the practical application of these concepts to contemporary social and political problems    
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Government and Politics of the USA 
  
  
  
    This module focuses on the institutions and processes of the government and politics of the United States. 
   
   
    
   
  
    It explores the concepts of limited government, constitutionalism and checks and balances and the way in which they operate in the American political system. It examines how American governments seek to make policy, the extent to which they can make an impact on society and the different types of constraints on their actions.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It also looks at how citizens attempt to influence the activities of government and their expectations and beliefs about what is the appropriate role for government.

   Airpower and Modern Warfare 
  
  
  
    Today, war without airpower is an unlikely prospect and major military operations, as a rule, are launched with overwhelming air attacks.  
   
   
    
   
  
    In recent years, the utility of ‘strategic’ airpower has increasingly come under question. Whilst technological innovation continues to strengthen airpower’s capabilities, the relevance of these capabilities in contemporary conflicts cannot be taken for granted.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This module critically assesses the role of air power in modern conflict within the broader framework of strategic and security studies. It will assess the evolution of air power theory since the First World War and examine the limits of its practical application with reference to specific air campaigns.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Particular emphasis will be placed on the role of air power in the post-Cold War security environment, for example, in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     develop a comprehensive understanding of developments in airpower strategy and its role in warfare from the First World War until today  
     demonstrate the ability to relate the role and uses of airpower to relevant theoretical debates in contemporary strategic and security studies   
     critically engage with the literature on airpower     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Dissertation 
  
 
   This module enables students to undertake a sustained piece of research and analysis into a subject within the discipline of politics and international relations.  
  
 
     
  
 
   Feminist Political Thought 
  
  
  
    What is feminism? Is it relevant today? This module will introduce the main branches of feminist thought, including liberal, socialist, radical, black and postcolonial feminisms. 
   
   
    
   
  
    We will also examine core themes in contemporary feminism, such identity, power, men and feminism, the role of women in politics and the politics of the private sphere (which raises the topics of sex and sexuality). 
   
   
    
   
  
    This module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     offer first-hand encounters with primary texts  
     build the skills to apply political theory to real life  
     give the ability to understand and compare key a range of feminist theories  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Governing Britains Cities: Power, Politics and Difference 
  
  
  
    Cities are places of both conflict and cooperation, characterised by civic pride and neighbourliness but also by social inequality and, on occasion, violent protest.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Cities are also places of difference, experienced in diverse ways by men and women, older and younger people, and by citizens from different ethnic and religious groups. Given such complexity, how should Britain’s cities be governed?  
   
   
    
   
  
    The module examines approaches to city leadership, local representation, citizenship and community engagement, and public service delivery.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Students will analyse contemporary policy issues (localism, Big Society, austerity, multiculturalism), gain a grounding in urban theory, and also have the chance to test their knowledge ‘on the ground’ (via case studies and presentations from policymakers, practitioners and activists).   
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     offer a critical overview of a range of theoretical approaches to understanding city governance and urban politics, including interdisciplinary insights  
     familiarise students with key issues in urban politics (top-down and bottom-up)  
     introduce students to the main policy options for governing cities, with particular reference to Britain  
     offer students the opportunity to critically assess research-based case studies  
     familiarise students with the challenges and opportunities faced by local policymakers and practitioners, and to enhance their employability in these areas  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Intervention in Africa 
  
  
  
    This module analyses political, economic, cultural and especially military intervention in Africa.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It focuses on the role of external actors such as International Organisations, regional organisations, and NGOs, with a special emphasis on the role of France, the UK and the European Union. We will examine theories, concepts and case studies to explain the nature of contemporary intervention. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     promote a critical engagement with material in the International Relations and European Foreign Policy field  
     provide an insight into the link between theory and practice of intervention  
     provide an understanding of why and how European governments respond to Africa issues  
     provide a basis for further study or careers in government, international organisations, media and the military  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Politics and Drugs 
  
  
  
    This module studies the implications of the growing abuse of narcotics for the political system from both a national and international perspective.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It will examine the production, consumption and trade in drugs as an international problem.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The development of and issues associated with contemporary British drug policy will be explored and the theoretical questions raised by drug control policy will be examined.   
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     consider the extent of the contemporary drug problem and its implications for national and international politics

     undertake a critical evaluation of UK and international drug policy  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Politics of East Asia 
  
  
  
    This module affords an understanding of the linkage between international and domestic politics in East Asia.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The module is divided into three parts: 
   
   
    
    
     The first part offers conceptual and historical perspectives that enable one to analyse how international and domestic politics relate to each other.  
     The second part focuses on China and Japan, and examines their domestic transformation and foreign policy development in the post-cold war period.   
     The third part focuses on key issues of the region, and examines how those issues affect domestic transformation of East Asian states, and in turn, how the domestic transformation affects those issues.   
    
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     enable students to identify and discuss conceptual and historical perspectives found in the literature on the politics of East Asia  
     explore ways to analyse the links between global and domestic politics in East Asia and how they relate to the conceptual and historical perspectives in the literature  
     develop a framework of enquiry within which students can construct subject-related knowledge and relevant research skills   
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Politics of Ethnic Conflict 
  
  
  
    Questions relating to nationalism and ethnic conflict have become more prominent in political debate since the end of the Cold War, and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrated the continuing importance of constitutional crafting as a means to manage ethnic diversity within states.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This module evaluates differing definitions of the ‘nation’ and ‘ethnic group’, examines different state strategies to manage diversity such as multiculturalism, assimilation and integration, and considers different explanations of conflict between different ethnic groups.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It then examines in more detail strategies adopted by particular states to manage their diversity.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The countries of India, America, France, Afghanistan, the UK, and Germany are focused upon, but students are encouraged to use material relating to other countries if they have particular knowledge of these cases.   
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     offer a critical overview of a range of approaches to understanding concepts of nationalism and ethnicity  
     introduce students to the different strategies of ethnic conflict regulation  
     offer students the opportunity to assess critically how these strategies are applied in various states  
     encourage students to consider the comparative implications of the strategies discussed   
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Rights and Wrongs of Climate Change 
  
  
  
    What should the world do about climate change? How should we proceed in the face of persistent claims that it won't do serious harm, or isn't occurring at all?  
   
   
    
   
  
    Should poor countries as well as rich ones be obliged to cut their carbon emissions? Is it wrong for individuals to fly? What if you offset your flight? How much weight should we accord harm that may come many years in the future?  
   
   
    
   
  
    Arguments about climate change raise many of the most controversial issues in contemporary ethics and political theory. This module will examine these debates and the broader questions they hinge on. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
    
    
     familiarise students with some of the key debates surrounding climate change  
     expand students' knowledge of moral philosophy, political theory and environmental ethics   
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Transforming Welfare States 
  
  
  
    Welfare is the biggest spending area for all advanced states and, in relation to migration, health care and unemployment, for example, an area of intense controversy. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This module explores the rapid changes that welfare states are undergoing, considers why this is happening and what are the limits of such change. The focus is relentlessly international and comparative. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      judge what has happened to change welfare states in the most recent period  
      assess the pressures for continuing change  
      evaluate the policy alternatives we now face  
     
    
   
     Students will develop skills in the evaluation of different theories of welfare and welfare change, a knowledge of the comparative world of differing welfare regimes and a capacity to judge theory against varying forms of empirical evidence.
