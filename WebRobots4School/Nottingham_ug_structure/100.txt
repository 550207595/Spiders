Modules  
  The modules we offer are inspired by the research interests of our staff and as a result, may change from year to year. The following list is therefore subject to change but should give you a flavour of the modules we offer. You can also view the undergraduate modules guide (PDF).  
  Please view the Contemporary Chinese Studies website for information on their modules.  
  Typical year one modules   
  Core modules   
 
   Current Economic Issues and Perspectives 
  
  
  
    This module focuses on a range of current issues facing the world economy, seeks to illustrate how economists model such issues, and examines potential policy responses.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Example topics to be covered are: 
   
   
   
    
     Globalisation  
     Economic growth  
     The global financial crisis  
     The world economy  
     Emerging economic superpowers  
     Consequences of rising economic nationalism  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     examine critically a number of current economic challenges facing the UK and the world economy  
     use economic analysis to investigate and clarify the underlying drivers of these challenges  
     identify potential gainers and losers and the role of economic policy in maximising the net benefits/minimizing the net costs  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Foundations of Macroeconomics 
  
  
   Macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate economy. This module will focus on the determinants of aggregate output, both in the short run - addressing cyclical movements of booms and busts - and in the long run - providing an introduction to economic growth.  
   A running theme will be debates over the role of the government in macroeconomic management, covering fiscal and monetary policy. The module will introduce a series of basic models used in modern macroeconomics.  
   This module aims to:  
   
   
    provide a sound basis in the fundamentals of macroeconomics and their application to both theoretical and real world situations  
    develop analytical skills using the major methods of mathematics and diagrams  
    engender the ability to communicate and report findings, particularly via tutorial essays, presentations and exercises  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Foundations of Microeconomics 
  
  
   This module begins by analysing how the economic choices of households and firms can be understood using consumer and producer theory. It then looks at how these individual choices are aggregated into market demand and supply to be mediated through the price mechanism.  
   A variety of market settings are considered, ranging from the paradigm of perfect competition to strategic interactions in oligopolistic markets. The module concludes by providing an introduction to the normative evaluation of economic outcomes in terms of individuals’ welfare, covering both market and government failures.  
   This module aims to:  
   
   
    provide a sound basis in the fundamentals of micro-economics and their application to both theoretical and real world situations  
    develop analytical skills using the major methods of mathematics and diagrams  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Mathematical Economics and Econometrics 
  
  
  
    The module is intended to provide an introduction to mathematical techniques used in economics. In particular, examples of economic issues that can be analysed using mathematical models will be discussed in detail. 
   
  
    Particular attention will be given to providing an intuitive understanding of the logic behind the formal results presented. Students who wish to pursue a higher degree in economics will find the module particularly useful. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a rigorous grounding in certain mathematical tools and methods of argumentation used in microeconomic theory  
     develop a clear perception of the role of mathematical tools and logical methods in the construction of the formal theory of individual decision-making  
     develop the ability to analyse economic problems through rigorous applications of the formal theory of individual decision-making  
    
   
  
 
     
  
  
  Or  
 
   Quantitative Economics 
  
  
   
    
     Introduction to mathematical economics: mathematical finance  
     Analysis of functions  
     Supply and demand  
     Matrix algebra  
     Differentiation  
     Elasticities  
     Maximisation/minimisation  
     Optimisation subject to constraints  
     Langrange multipliers  
     Integration  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide a basis in the fundamentals of Mathematics most relevant to the study of Economics  
     allow students to see how mathematical tools can be applied in the analysis of theoretical economic problems  
     facilitate the development of analytical skills leading to an understanding of which economic problems are susceptible to a formal treatment, and which results are capable of formal proof

  Core modules    
 
   Principles of Macroeconomics 
  
  
  
    This module will address both the fundamental and applied aspects of macroeconomic theory. 
   
   
    
   
  
    In particular, the module will focus on: 
   
   
   
    
     Introducing the modern theory of expectations and economic dynamics  
     Using this approach to think about short run fluctuations  
     Studying the role of macro policy on short run fluctuations  
    
   
  
    The module will review the so-called modern approach to aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This entails incorporating into the classical approach to aggregate supply and aggregate demand insights from Keynesian economics. This will serve as a base to discuss the role of macro-policy in controlling for fluctuations in output and employment. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     introduce the students to the main issues and developments of modern macroeconomics.  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Principles of Microeconomics 
  
  
  
    Intermediate microeconomics including general equilibrium analysis, welfare economics, elementary game theory, and strategic behaviour of firms. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     build upon the microeconomics you encountered in year 1  
     develop analytical skills by employing standard diagrammatic analysis and reference to the underlying mathematical techniques  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Econometrics 
  
  
  
    This module generalises and builds upon the econometric techniques covered in the Year I module, Introductory Econometrics. This will involve introducing a number of new statistical and econometric concepts, together with some further development of the methodology that was introduced in Year I. The multivariate linear regression model will again provide our main framework for analysis. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide the necessary mathematical and statistical tools needed to conduct theoretical econometric analysis at an advanced level  
     develop the analytical skills required to demonstrate the theoretical properties of different econometric estimation and testing procedures under various modelling assumptions  
     provide a sound understanding of the applicability and limitations of the multivariate linear regression model as a vehicle for econometric analysis for economic data
