   Dissertation: International Relations/International Studies 
  
  
   The researching and writing of a substantive dissertation within the field of international relations/studies. The dissertation must be between 14,000-16,000 words.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    provide students with the opportunity to produce a substantial piece of independent research in the area of international relations  
    provide a focus for the application by students of the knowledge and skills relating to issues within international relations which they have developed from other modules on the programme  
    provide quality supervision by matching the research interests of students with those of members of staff in the School of Politics and International Relations who are familiar with their chosen research topic  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Terrorism and Insurgencies 
  
  
   This module is designed to acquaint students with two of the most important aspects of contemporary international security: terrorism and insurgencies.  
   Both threats have become more acute in recent years and much intellectual, military and economic capital has been used up in efforts to contain them. In taking this module, students will begin to understand the nature of the threats posed by terrorists and insurgents. They will understand how such threats come about and why individuals are drawn towards exercising the use of force against certain governments, their representatives, and the citizens of those governments.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    build an understanding of the development of the four main waves of modern terrorism and of contemporary efforts in the realm of counter-terrorism  
    develop an awareness of the debates surrounding the changes in nature terrorism and the problematic nature of the response of the liberal state  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Theories and Concepts in International Relations 
  
  
   The War on Iraq and the US and British invasion of the country in 2003 has led to huge tensions in geopolitics. At the same time, the supposed 'threat' of international terrorism and continuing financial turmoil in the world economy have both brought to the fore the global politics of co-operation and confrontation.  
   The purpose of this module is to make students aware of the diversity of approaches to international theory. Within International Relations (IR) theory there exist highly divergent interpretations and applications of key concepts (eg power, the state, agency, structure, and world order) as well as contested views about the practical purpose underpinning theories of world politics.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    familiarise students with the contemporary literature and debates  
    appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of competing approaches  
    develop an understanding of how key concepts are conceived and applied in international relations  
    develop a critical comparison of the application of the dominant explanatory models  
    understand the reasons for the use of specific approaches  
   
  
 
     
  
  Optional modules  
 
   Comparative Democratic Development 
  
  
   At the dawn of the 21st century, the status of democracy across the world is uncertain. In Central and Eastern Europe, it has become the only game in town, but in other regions like Russia or the Arab World it has suffered reversals.  
   To make sense of these events, this module examines and is structured around some of the big, important questions that have long interested political scientists around the questions of democracy:  
   
    what is democracy?   
    why are some countries democratic and others not?   
    how did democracy emerge in different countries?   
    what difference does democracy make for people’s lives?   
   
   The module adopts a global and comparative perspective, by focusing on countries in specific regions and by studying different data-sets on the design, functioning and influence of democratic institutions.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    introduce students to a variety of theoretical perspectives on democratic and authoritarian regimes and their empirical manifestation  
    introduce students to debates surrounding the economic and cultural pre-requisites of democracy  
    introduce students to the different models of democratisation (liberalisation, transition, consolidation) and their empirical manifestation  
    introduce students to the influence of democracy on different facets of development, like public sector size, conflict regulation and wealth redistribution  
    encourage students to think broadly and critically about the possibility of democracy in different parts of the world, the difficulties of crafting democratic regimes  
    invite students to reflect on the role of structures and actors in the emergence, stability and consolidation of democratic regime  
    invite students to consider the merits of different methodological tools (qualitative and quantitative) for studying different facets of democratic development  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Contemporary Warfare 
  
  
   This module will primarily address the increased role that non-state actors play in global security. It will introduce students to empirical analyses of numerous terrorist and insurgent groups, as well as to theoretical understandings of sub-state violence in the post-9/11 world.  
   The events of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent American declaration of a ‘War on Terror’ have recast the focus of global security. The attack upon a hegemonic superpower by violent non-state actors placed terrorism at the centre of Western concepts of contemporary security and enabled President Bush to redraw international relations along the fault-line of those either ‘with us or against us’ in a global effort to eradicate terrorist threats.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students a broad understanding of the role non-state actors play in contemporary global security  
    build a conceptual and empirical appreciation of how states and non-state actors interact in the realm of contemporary global security  
    offer an understanding of how the influence and importance of non-state actors to the dynamics of global security has changed  
    build an understanding as to the motives behind violent sub-state behaviour before and after 9/11

   Grand Strategy 
  
  
   This module examines how nations have sought to integrate political, economic, and military goals to preserve their long-term interests. It analyses a variety of national strategies in order to understand how geography, history, culture, and finance influence decision making at the highest levels of government in times of war and peace.

   International Political Economy 
  
  
   The module will introduce students to the main approaches to International Political Economy, providing a brief overview of the post-war international political economy, before the main focus is turned towards globalisation and the related structural changes in the global economy.  
   This will include a theoretical engagement with the concepts of globalisation, regionalisation and regionalism as well as an analysis of empirical changes in the areas of international trade, finance, production and development with a particular emphasis on the current global economic crisis.   
   The module will further address the question of the relationship between globalisation and the individual instances of regional integration including the EU, NAFTA and APEC, before it looks at recent formations of resistance to globalisation expressed in demonstrations against G8 meetings (e.g. Heligendamm 2007) as well as developments around the European and World Social Forums.

   Justice Beyond Borders: Theories of International and Intergenerational Justice 
  
  
   The module introduces and explores the concept of distributive justice on an international and intergenerational basis. It examines how justice has traditionally been conceptualised, and challenges the idea of the nation-state as providing limits to the proper operation of principles of justice.  
   Justice between nations, and between generations, as well as between humans and non-humans, forms the focus of this module. The programme for dealing with these themes includes:   
   
    international theories of justice, with particular reference to faminie relief and humanitarian intervention

   The Politics of South Asia 
  
  
   This module introduces students to the politics of modern South Asia, focusing on Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  
   The region is growing in international importance both strategically, economically and politically. The module evaluates alternative explanations for the different democratic trajectories of these states, despite their shared colonial past, and the interaction between 'tradition' and 'modernity' in developing political institutions.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    introduce students to the political history of South Asia, in order that they may develop an understanding of the multiple challenges the different states faced

    develop a critical and comparative understanding of contemporary South Asian politics, both internally and externally  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Road to Guantanamo: The Treatment and Experience of Prisoners, Civilian Internees and Detainees since 1860 
  
  
   This module explores the way in which state authorities have treated prisoners of war, civilian internees and detainees from circa 1860 - the dawn of the modern era of international humanitarian law - to the present day. It examines developments in state practice and international law relating to the detention of 'enemy' individuals, and explores different national, ideological and cultural approaches to the issue of captivity.  
   The module is explicitly historical in character and methodology but will draw on international and political theory where appropriate to explain state and individual behaviour.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    develop students' understanding of current issues relating to the detention of prisoners and enemy combatants through a study of different historical periods and experiences  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Theory and Practice of Diplomacy 
  
  
   This module focuses on the changing nature of diplomatic practice, together with the range of conceptual tools that seek to explain this international activity.   
   It provides a political analysis of new developments such as the public diplomacy, the decline of resident embassies and foreign ministries, and the role of regional/multinational organisations and summitry.  
   It also encourages students to consider future theoretical and practical developments in this field.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    offer an advanced study of the theory and practice of current diplomacy  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   War, Peace and Terror 
  
  
   This module explores the blurring boundaries between war and peace, and the implications for understanding security. The first section assesses the changing nature of warfare, including theories of asymmetric warfare and terrorism; the second section examines the ‘dark arts’ of international relations, from assassination to psychological warfare, operating in the grey area between war and peace.  
   With large scale conventional warfare increasingly unlikely, the third section considers ‘new’ security issues in peacetime such as poverty and disease.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students critical understanding of the blurring boundaries between war and peace in the modern world  
    introduce students to a range of issues, from terrorism to covert action, which are increasingly challenging conventional distinctions between war and peace  
    introduce students to theories of war, peace, and security and impart an awareness of how the ‘security’ agenda of states and societies is changing  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Western Counter-Terrorism Cooperation 
  
  
   Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States and Europe have sought to cooperate on counter-terrorism policies and this module will investigate both the substance of this cooperation as well as the conceptual thinking on which it is based.   
   It will seek to determine whether a coherent US-European approach to countering transnational terrorism is emerging and whether this approach can provide a foundation for a wider international counter-terrorism architecture.  
   Attention will be paid to multilateral approaches to combating terrorism through organisations such as the United Nations and attempts by the transatlantic allies to extend counter-terrorism cooperation to the wider international community.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    help students appreciate the complex internal and external security challenges presented by contemporary terrorism  
    engage with the literature and theories on counter-terrorism policy  
    understand that western counter-terrorism policy requires international cooperation across several policy fields  
    gain awareness of different priorities in counter-terrorism policy  
    appreciate the obstacles that confront counter-terrorism cooperation and the delicate balance in providing security whilst safeguarding civil liberties  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   When does Russia Expand and Why? 
  
  
   Russia’s annexation of the Crimea will strike many Westerners as merely the latest chapter in a long history of Russian imperialism. Does Russia always expand when it has the opportunity? Or is its expansion, when it occurs, explained by contingent factors?  
   This module will examine Russia’s expansion and contraction from the 17th century to the present, and the causes underlying it.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    examine patterns of Russian expansion and restraint, and theories that may help us understand them and predict the future  
   
  
 
     
  
   
  Please note that modules may change in order to keep abreast of political and academic developments.
