   Dynamics of International Social Policy 
  
  
   This module offers students the opportunity to spend some time with an organisation working in a field related to crime, victimisation or criminal justice (a ‘criminal justice organisation’).   
   The organisation may be in the public, private or third sectors and students will be able to get a sense of the way in which the issues they have encountered in their academic studies are experienced and addressed in practice. In some cases they may also be able to contribute in a practical way to the work of the organisation.  
   The academic element of the module focuses on encouraging students to reflect on their experiences observing and contributing to the work of the organisation with which they have spent time in the light of a relevant body of criminological literature and what they have learnt in other contexts.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    enable students to experience at first hand, and reflect critically on, the work of organisations in fields related to crime, victimisation and criminal justice and to make appropriate use of the knowledge, understanding and skills they have gained through studying criminology
