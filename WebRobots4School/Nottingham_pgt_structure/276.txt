Modules  
   The current modules are:  
  
   Contexts  
   Understanding Learning  
   Approaches to Teaching  
   Investigating Student Understanding  
  
  Each of the modules is 15 credits at level four (masters). Marks of 50% or higher for a module will result in Masters credit which gives the possibility of credit towards an MA Education (180 credits are needed for the MA). For the MA, several of our modules are available online. There are block modules in our UK Summer School (late July and early August each year) where 60 credits of face-to-face taught credits can be achieved. We also teach modules in Kuala Lumpur (30 credits over two weekends). Thereafter, the 60- credit dissertation is supported at a distance.
