   Introduction to Public Procurement Regulation: Basic Principles and Concepts 
  
  
  
    This module examines basic concepts in procurement regulation.

    The module then considers how these objectives and principles are typically implemented and balanced in regulatory rules. This is done primarily through a study of the main rules of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement 2011.
