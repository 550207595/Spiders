Modules  
  The course comprises three core modules and you can then choose an elective option. It is possible to take one module in an online format if that is convenient for you, or a study preference. The MA programme is then completed with a 60-credit dissertation.  
  The aims of the three core modules are to:  
  
   develop your understanding of ICT and the learner by making a study of theories of human learning and how you guide practice in the wide variety of educational contexts where technology is in use  
   develop a critical understanding of ICT and its social context within education by making a study of the interpersonal, corporate, societal and political circumstances surrounding the adoption of ICT in teaching and learning
