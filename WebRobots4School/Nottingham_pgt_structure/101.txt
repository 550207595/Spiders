   Contemporary Warfare 
  
  
   This module will primarily address the increased role that non-state actors play in global security. It will introduce students to empirical analyses of numerous terrorist and insurgent groups, as well as to theoretical understandings of sub-state violence in the post-9/11 world.  
   The events of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent American declaration of a ‘War on Terror’ have recast the focus of global security. The attack upon a hegemonic superpower by violent non-state actors placed terrorism at the centre of Western concepts of contemporary security and enabled President Bush to redraw international relations along the fault-line of those either ‘with us or against us’ in a global effort to eradicate terrorist threats.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students a broad understanding of the role non-state actors play in contemporary global security  
    build a conceptual and empirical appreciation of how states and non-state actors interact in the realm of contemporary global security  
    offer an understanding of how the influence and importance of non-state actors to the dynamics of global security has changed  
    build an understanding as to the motives behind violent sub-state behaviour before and after 9/11

   Justice Beyond Borders: Theories of International and Intergenerational Justice 
  
  
   The module introduces and explores the concept of distributive justice on an international and intergenerational basis. It examines how justice has traditionally been conceptualised, and challenges the idea of the nation-state as providing limits to the proper operation of principles of justice.

   Terrorism and Insurgencies 
  
  
   This module is designed to acquaint students with two of the most important aspects of contemporary international security: terrorism and insurgencies.  
   Both threats have become more acute in recent years and much intellectual, military and economic capital has been used up in efforts to contain them. In taking this module, students will begin to understand the nature of the threats posed by terrorists and insurgents. They will understand how such threats come about and why individuals are drawn towards exercising the use of force against certain governments, their representatives, and the citizens of those governments.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    build an understanding of the development of the four main waves of modern terrorism and of contemporary efforts in the realm of counter-terrorism  
    develop an awareness of the debates surrounding the changes in nature terrorism and the problematic nature of the response of the liberal state  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Theories and Concepts in International Relations 
  
  
   The War on Iraq and the US and British invasion of the country in 2003 has led to huge tensions in geopolitics. At the same time, the supposed 'threat' of international terrorism and continuing financial turmoil in the world economy have both brought to the fore the global politics of co-operation and confrontation.  
   The purpose of this module is to make students aware of the diversity of approaches to international theory. Within International Relations (IR) theory there exist highly divergent interpretations and applications of key concepts (eg power, the state, agency, structure, and world order) as well as contested views about the practical purpose underpinning theories of world politics.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    familiarise students with the contemporary literature and debates  
    appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of competing approaches  
    develop an understanding of how key concepts are conceived and applied in international relations  
    develop a critical comparison of the application of the dominant explanatory models  
    understand the reasons for the use of specific approaches  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Politics of South Asia 
  
  
   This module introduces students to the politics of modern South Asia, focusing on Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.  
   The region is growing in international importance both strategically, economically and politically. The module evaluates alternative explanations for the different democratic trajectories of these states, despite their shared colonial past, and the interaction between 'tradition' and 'modernity' in developing political institutions.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    introduce students to the political history of South Asia, in order that they may develop an understanding of the multiple challenges the different states faced  
    compare the political institutions of the states of South Asia, and to provide an understanding of the relationship of 'traditional' societies with 'modern' democratic institutions  
    develop a critical and comparative understanding of contemporary South Asian politics, both internally and externally  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   The Road to Guantanamo: The Treatment and Experience of Prisoners, Civilian Internees and Detainees since 1860 
  
  
   This module explores the way in which state authorities have treated prisoners of war, civilian internees and detainees from circa 1860 - the dawn of the modern era of international humanitarian law - to the present day. It examines developments in state practice and international law relating to the detention of 'enemy' individuals, and explores different national, ideological and cultural approaches to the issue of captivity.  
   The module is explicitly historical in character and methodology but will draw on international and political theory where appropriate to explain state and individual behaviour.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    develop students' understanding of current issues relating to the detention of prisoners and enemy combatants through a study of different historical periods and experiences  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   War, Peace and Terror 
  
  
   This module explores the blurring boundaries between war and peace, and the implications for understanding security. The first section assesses the changing nature of warfare, including theories of asymmetric warfare and terrorism; the second section examines the ‘dark arts’ of international relations, from assassination to psychological warfare, operating in the grey area between war and peace.  
   With large scale conventional warfare increasingly unlikely, the third section considers ‘new’ security issues in peacetime such as poverty and disease.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students critical understanding of the blurring boundaries between war and peace in the modern world  
    introduce students to a range of issues, from terrorism to covert action, which are increasingly challenging conventional distinctions between war and peace  
    introduce students to theories of war, peace, and security and impart an awareness of how the ‘security’ agenda of states and societies is changing  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Western Counter-Terrorism Cooperation 
  
  
   Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States and Europe have sought to cooperate on counter-terrorism policies and this module will investigate both the substance of this cooperation as well as the conceptual thinking on which it is based.   
   It will seek to determine whether a coherent US-European approach to countering transnational terrorism is emerging and whether this approach can provide a foundation for a wider international counter-terrorism architecture.  
   Attention will be paid to multilateral approaches to combating terrorism through organisations such as the United Nations and attempts by the transatlantic allies to extend counter-terrorism cooperation to the wider international community.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    help students appreciate the complex internal and external security challenges presented by contemporary terrorism  
    engage with the literature and theories on counter-terrorism policy  
    understand that western counter-terrorism policy requires international cooperation across several policy fields  
    gain awareness of different priorities in counter-terrorism policy  
    appreciate the obstacles that confront counter-terrorism cooperation and the delicate balance in providing security whilst safeguarding civil liberties  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   When does Russia Expand and Why? 
  
  
   Russia’s annexation of the Crimea will strike many Westerners as merely the latest chapter in a long history of Russian imperialism. Does Russia always expand when it has the opportunity? Or is its expansion, when it occurs, explained by contingent factors?  
   This module will examine Russia’s expansion and contraction from the 17th century to the present, and the causes underlying it.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    examine patterns of Russian expansion and restraint, and theories that may help us understand them and predict the future  
   
  
 
     
  
  
  Subject to the approval of appropriate staff, students may be permitted to take modules offered in the Schools of Law and History, however these must relate closely to the field of diplomacy.  
  Please note that modules may change in order to keep abreast of political and academic developments.
