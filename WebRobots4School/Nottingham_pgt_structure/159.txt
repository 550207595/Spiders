   Between Europe and the Middle East: Critical Questions of Citizenship and Identity 
  
  
  
    This module will focus on two geo-political regions: Europe and the Middle East in order to explore and analyse a set of relevant discourses that pertain to understandings and experiences of citizenship and the political conditions for full citizenship.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Discourses of freedom, human rights, democracy, gender and multi-culturalism will be of particular concern. These discourses will be situated within the specific Regions of Europe and the Middle East and the module will end with the case example of Turkey as a country which perhaps bridges the Middle East and Europe.

   Human Rights and Critical Modern Slavery 
  
  
   This module critically interrogates dominant liberal discourse on human rights and modern slavery.  
   Drawing on academic, popular and policy debate on human rights and case studies of phenomena that are deemed to constitute contemporary human enslavement - such as human trafficking, prostitution, domestic servitude, worst forms of child labour, forced labour and bonded labour in a number of sectors and regions - the module offers an opportunity to critically deconstruct the theoretical and political assumptions that underpin this discourse.   
   The module ultimately aims to draw students’ attention to the deep connections between human rights and social, economic and political inequality on the basis of gender, class, race, sexuality, age and other identity markers under contemporary conditions of globalisation.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    provide students with advanced level sociological knowledge of the concepts of human rights, globalisation, and modern slavery, an appreciation of the connections between these, and a critical understanding of their application in a range of discourses  
    equip students with knowledge and understanding of the relationship between policy concern with modern slavery and processes of globalisation  
    make students aware of how the changing cultural and political landscape can affect some groups’ ability to access human rights  
    facilitate an understanding of sociological debate and theory on concepts of globalisation, human rights, and modern slavery and their intersection with debate and theory in other disciplines  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Researching Global Citizenship, Identities and Human Rights 
  
  
   This module provides a general introduction to a range of key issues in the design and conduct of social research, explores the interplay between philosophical, methodological and ethical issues in research on global citizenship, identities and human rights, and provides guidance on writing both a dissertation proposal and a dissertation.  
   The module is taught by means of seminars and workshops. By the end of the module students will be equipped with the methodological and practical skills to critically evaluate research evidence on global citizenship, identities and human rights and to carry out independent research for their dissertation.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    explore some of the major issues (epistemological, practical and ethical) involved with undertaking research on global citizenship, identities and human rights  
    develop students' ability to critically evaluate research evidence  
    examine the relevance of more abstract methodological debates for actual research as practiced in ‘the real world’  
     enhance students’ study skills and develop skills in desk, documentary, archival and other research methods  
    familiarise students with the major issues associated with undertaking postgraduate dissertation research on global citizenship, identities and human rights
