   Post-Conflict Situations and International Law 
  
  
   This module will examine the international legal problems arising from international involvement in post-conflict situations.  
   While there are established courses and literature on the jus ad bellum (use of force) and the jus in bello (international humanitarian law), the idea and content of a jus post bellum has only in recent years been the subject of intense debate.
