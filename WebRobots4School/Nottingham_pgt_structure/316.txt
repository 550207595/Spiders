The module is based on a beginners’ textbook, supported by additional materials. The module also includes aspects of daily and cultural life.  
  Slovene Language Diploma Part 2  
  The module is taught using materials from written, audio and video sources. It includes exercises in summarising texts in the target language, comprehension of written and spoken material, translation from and into the target language, guided composition writing and oral presentations. The module builds on the skills acquired in the first semester, with more emphasis on independent learning and developing the ability to break down complex linguistic structures in order to facilitate comprehension and communication skills. An important element of the module is a portfolio of work related to the student’s area of research or professional interest, which helps students build up vocabulary related to their subject.
