   Contemporary Issues and Debates in Social Work 
  
  
   This module examines the nature of contemporary debates and issues in social work by focusing on the nature of knowledge in social work and some of the main social theories which conceptualise social work and its relationship to the state, society and the individual.  
   Students will be enabled to understand how different theoretical approaches provide different ways of thinking about the nature of social work in advanced modern societies and their implications for social work practice.   
   The debates covered will include:  
   
    how to protect children and vulnerable adults  
    personalisation and adult care  
    the role of research in social work and evidence-based practice  
    reflexivity  
    structure/agency, power and inequalities  
    risk and the bureaucratisation of social work  
   
   This module aims to:  
   
    allow students to understand the key debates in theory and practice, and how different theoretical perspectives seek to explain and define what social work is

   This module aims to:  
   
    allow students to demonstrate that they have the skills and knowledge to enable the identification of a researchable question, develop a research proposal, carry out a literature review and carry empirical research relevant to the research question  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Foundations in Qualitative Methods 
  
  
   This module provides a conceptual overview of the various approaches and debates associated with theory and practice of qualitative research. It examines a range of contrasting perspectives on the design of research including problem identification, selection and sampling, and analysis.  
   Research ethics, and the role of the researcher in generating qualitative data, are key themes which run through the module. Specific consideration is given to the ways in which qualitative and quantitative approaches may be seen as complementary, and the use of mixed methods.   
   The module will also cover the ways in which qualitative research can be evaluated.   
   This module aims to:  
   
    give students the necessary theoretical underpinnings to plan, conduct and evaluate qualitative research

    This module deals with social, ethical, regulatory & cultural questions that emerge from key processes & products of social & technological innovation within business, governments & civil society. 
   
   
    
   
  
    The module will scrutinise the development of these technologies in the context of society, language, media and culture. It will also ask the following: 
   
   
    
     how innovations and societies mutually shape each other  
     how innovations impact our understanding of self and society  
     how they influence how we think about rights & responsibilities  
    
   
  
    Case studies of technologies from fields such digital, information & communication technologies, nanotechnology, & energy will be used to develop key themes which students will apply to their own areas of work. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     provide an understanding of both the social, ethical, legal and political issues raised in these developing fields and of the range of conceptual approaches used to examine the social shaping of science and technology and the scientific and technological shaping of society

   Investigating Social Policy 
  
  
  
    The module will examine the flow of policy making, from inception to implementation.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The first part of the module will explore various theories of policy making at different levels and will take the form of a seminar with previous set readings. The latter part of the module will be related to recent or current research undertaken by central or local government in the UK, or Europe, though examples may also come from other countries.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     allow students to identify the explanatory, empirical and conceptual means of understanding the context and content of policy initiatives, and to undertake a detailed case study of their choice  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Policy Analysis: Concepts and Theories 
  
  
   This module provides an applied, critical and informed understanding of policy-making and policy analysis in government.  
   It examines key concepts, models and theories of policy-making and policy analysis, and illustrates them by examining policy-making in Britain and other countries.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    reflect critically upon the meanings of public policy  
    understand the interplay of key actors in the processes of making public policy  
    evaluate public policy  
    assess key concepts of policy analysis  
    examine competing theories of public policy in modelling the policy process  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Political Theory and Social Policy 
  
  
   Social policy is underpinned by a wide variety of social, political and economic theories. Without an understanding of these theories, our analyses of both society and of welfare systems are likely to be inadequate.   
   For instance, we may overlook the extent to which policies and welfare reforms are sometimes based upon weak theoretical foundations and assumptions.   
   This module explores a range of both traditional and contemporary themes and concepts, including:  
   
    liberty  
    equality  
    citizenship  
    needs  
    class  
    old and new welfare ideologies  
    recent developments in welfare theory  
   
   This module aims to:  
   
    deepen students' understanding of social policy through detailed analyses of specific theoretical issues; and to enable students to utilise abstract concepts and principles themselves, relating these to `real life' themes and problems.  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Research the Social: Contemporary Debates in Sociology 
  
  
   The module will require students to develop a critical and reflexive understanding of key substantive and theoretical debates in the field of contemporary sociology.  
   Throughout the module, students will be encouraged to explore the relationship between theoretical development and substantive explanation. Students will also be required to develop a reflexive and critical understanding of how theoretical assumptions impinge both on social theory and sociological explanation.   
   The substantive debates to be covered may vary from year to year in order to accommodate new developments in the field, while ensuring that a wide range of sociological theories are represented. However the following list provides a sample of possible candidates for inclusion: Social Inequality, Social Change, Modernity and Postmodernity, Power, Globalisation, Identity and Belonging, Capital.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    develop an understanding of the relationship between theoretical development and sociological explanation, as well as the centrality of the theoretical assumptions that structure these debate  
    provide the opportunity to engage critically with some key contemporary debates  
   
  
 
     
  
  Optional modules  
  Students need to choose 4 x 10 credit advanced training modules from the following list:  
 
   Archival Methods 
  
  
  
    Informed by insights from other disciplinary contexts, this module will explore how and why the archive as a research site might similarly be of interest to qualitative sociologists and investigate how archival documents can be used in research.  
   
   
    
   
  
    The module will therefore both offer an introduction to archive theory and a hands-on introduction to working with a variety of archival documents. The module will consider the following issues: 
   
   
   
    
     how might we define the status and purpose of the archive and its contents?  
     how does the archive’s status and purpose influence our mode of engagement with it?  
     what are the politics of the archive? What ‘traces’ are present, what missing, with what gendered, ‘raced’, classed etc. results?  
     how have historians and others worked with and within the archive, given these limitations?  
     what are the advantages and limitations in ‘re-using’ qualitative archived data?  
     approaches to interpreting archival documents  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      problematise the meaning and status of the archive and its contents  
      understand the ways in which archival documents might be used in sociological research  
      acquire knowledge of the appropriate theoretical and methodological tools to critically analyse a range of archival documents  
      understand different approaches to interpreting a range of documents in the archival context  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Doing Ethnography 
  
  
  
    This module considers in detail 'ethnography' as a qualitative research method.  
   
   
    
   
  
    It explores the underlying principles and practices of the approach, which, broadly speaking, involves studying people 'at first hand', in detail, usually at length and in the context in which they live, work, play etc. It will explore: 
   
   
   
    
     key concepts and approaches  
     important ethnographic studies  
     critiques, strengths and weaknesses  
     designing and planning your own ethnographic study  
     students will experience a range of learning methods including lectures, workshops, film viewings, student presentations and group work  
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     give students knowledge of the practical and theoretical underpinnings of the ethnographic method  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Individual and Group Interviews 
  
  
  
    This block will involve practically-oriented sessions, to explore a variety of individual and group interview approaches. This will include focus groups as well as structured, semi-structured, and more open-ended styles of interviewing (including narrative approaches). It will also consider the use of stimulus material, vignettes, and critical incidents as possible ways of structuring interview interactions. 
   
   
    
   
  
    Sessions will include practical demonstrations of interviewing, and will involve the analysis of interview transcripts, along with published research papers, which use different analytical approaches.  
   
   
    
   
  
    Among a range of issues that will be considered, it will discuss some of the ethical issues that can arise when this type of fieldwork is being conducted, and there will be plenty of opportunity for group members to draw upon their own research experiences within this and other discussions.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      give students practical, hands-on experience in using different qualitative approaches to the individual and group interviews, and think through some of the methodological and epistemological issues that it gives rise to  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Researching Media, Culture and Society 
  
  
  
    This module will offer a masterclass in key debates and issues in the Anglo-American media in order to explore a range of theories about popular media and different approaches to studying a range of media genres. It problematises the role of the media in contemporary culture and society in two specific contexts:  
   
   
   
    
     gender and identity   
     science and society   
    
   
  
    The gender and identity block will explore feminist theories about popular media, with the emphasis on exploring research methods and methodologies appropriate for analysing gendered mediated representations as they intersect with other axes of difference such as race, class and sexuality. 
   
   
    
   
  
    science and society aims to engage students with the way that the media frame issues through culturally situated language and images, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these ways of framing, steering and stimulating public debate about science and technology.  
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to: 
   
   
   
    
     
      problematise the role of the media in contemporary culture and society, using the case studies of ‘gender and identity’, ‘science and society’ and ‘culture and citizenship’  
      acquire knowledge of the appropriate theoretical and methodological tools to critically analyse a range of media texts  
      understand the ways in which media representations are classed, racialised and sexualised as well as gendered  
      understand the ideological, professional, cultural and technological factors governing the practices of the mass media  
     
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Researching Public Policy and Management 
  
  
  
    This module covers some of the main approaches to researching public policy and public management.

     comparative research (in particular cross-country research)  
     researching networks and governance arrangements  
     use of performance indicators  
     elite interviewing and the evaluation of policies and cost-benefit analysis  
    
   
  
    The module will also use case studies to illustrate the designs, methodologies and methods discussed. 
   
   
    
   
  
    This 
   module aims to:
