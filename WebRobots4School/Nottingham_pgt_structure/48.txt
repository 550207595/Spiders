  After completion of the taught modules, during the summer semester, a ten-week work study project worth 60 credits is undertaken in a subject area agreed with the Course Director. This work-study project can be carried out in the UK or abroad. The project allows you to specialise in a specific area relevant to the course. It gives you the opportunity to put your newly-learned skills into practice in one large, intensive project.
