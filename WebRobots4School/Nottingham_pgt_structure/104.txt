   Experimental and Behavioural Economics 
  
  
   This module provides a foundation in behavioural economics and the role of experimental methods in economics.  
   The traditional approach in economics is to explain market outcomes and economic decision-making using simple theoretical models based on perfectly rational, self-interested agents who maximise their well-being by carefully weighing up the costs and benefits of different alternatives. Behavioural economics, on the other hand, aspires to relax these stringent assumptions and develop an understanding of how real people actually make decisions.   
   The module will introduce students to behavioural and experimental economics, discuss these fields from a methodological perspective and examine several areas of economic analysis in which they are applied. This will include individual choice under risk and uncertainty, decision-making in strategic situations and competition in markets.

     introduce students to the technical tools required for understanding and developing microeconomic models of behaviour of optimising individuals  
     show how these tools facilitate the analysis of simple optimising models of choice and of the interaction of optimising individuals  
     provide some practice, through exercises, in the application of these technical tools  
    
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Monetary Economics 
  
  
   This course will provide a foundation for the monetary economics modules in the third year and is a complement to financial economics for the second and third years.  
   It will cover topics such as the definitions and role of money, portfolio choice, financial markets and banks, central banks and monetary policy, and the monetary transmission mechanism.   
   Under these headings the module will address issues of theory, policy and practice relating to recent experience in the UK and other countries. The module will feature some current debates and controversies based on recent events.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    build on core macroeconomic understanding to explore monetary economics  
    study in detail various topical issues in the field of monetary economics  
    give students a comprehensive grasp of underpinnings of monetary policy analysis  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Public Sector Economics 
  
  
   This module looks at:  
   
    public finances in the UK

    social insurance: social security, taxation and equity  
    excess burden of taxation and tax incidence  
   
   This module aims to:  
   
    introduce students to the basic conceptual vocabulary of the economic analysis of public sector economics  
    lay the foundations necessary for an understanding of those Third Year courses drawing on such a conceptual framework  
    stimulate an interest in public sector issues  
    inform students of the current agenda of public sector analysis  
    instruct in the basic analytic techniques, thereby enabling students to make informed policy judgements in the field  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Quantitative Economics III 
  
  
   This module is an introduction to the theory and practice of econometric methods, focusing on regression analysis and its application to economic situations.  
   The module will pay particular attention to the principles of estimation and inference in the multiple regression model, and will rely on illustrations and intuition to develop understanding of the techniques and their interpretation.   
   Students deepen their understanding of the material covered in class via a series of ‘hands-on’ computer classes using specialist econometric software (EViews) and a set of tutorials that will review worked examples.  
   This module aims to:  
   
    introduce students to the principles, uses and interpretation of regression analysis most commonly employed in applied economics using cross-section data  
    provide students with sufficient knowledge of regression methods to critically evaluate and interpret published empirical research  
    enable students to undertake empirical analyses using specialist econometric software  
   
  
 
     
  
 
   Quantitative Economics IV 
  
  
   This module is an introduction to the theory and practice of econometric methods, focusing on regression analysis and its application to economic situations.  
   It will focus on practical issues relating to data modelling and issues relating to model specification and testing, as well as introducing students to regression analysis using time series data. It will rely on illustrations and intuition to develop understanding of the techniques and their interpretation.   
   Students will advance their understanding of the material covered in class via a series of ‘hands-on’ computer classes using EViews.
