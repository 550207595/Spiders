Course content 
 The MEng Chemical Engineering full-time course follows a five year curriculum including a final year of advanced topics and project. 
 Year 1 - Fundamentals
 
   The first-year of study focuses on basic principles and fundamentals of chemical engineering, including: 
   
   tools and techniques 
   mathematics for engineers 
   chemistry for chemical engineers 
   practical chemistry 
   
  You'll also study elective classes selected from across the University. 
 
 Year 2 - Core Chemical Engineering
  
  In second year, you'll study areas such as: 
   
   process analysis and statistics 
   fluid flow and heat transfer 
   safety 
   chemical engineering laboratory 
   thermodynamics and chemical principles 
   advanced mathematics 
   
 
 Year 3 - Core Chemical Engineering
  
  The third year of study includes: 
   
   reactors 
   biochemical engineering 
   materials and processes 
   chemical engineering design 
   advanced IT 
   mass transfer and separation processes 
   ethics 
   sustainability and economics 
   chemical engineering laboratory 
   
 
 Year 4 - Chemical Engineering Design
  
  The fourth year of study includes: 
   
   particle technology 
   multiphase systems 
   process control 
   environmental technology 
   advanced separations 
   problem solving 
   
  The second semester is entirely devoted to the chemical engineering design project. 
 
 Year 5 - Advanced Chemical Engineering
  
  The final year of study offers a range of advanced options, including: 
   
   nanotechnology 
   emerging technologies 
   safety management
