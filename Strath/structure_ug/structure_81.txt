 Engineering Design For Software Development 1 
  
  This class will teach elementary computer programming for the absolute beginner. We begin with an introduction of how a computer process instructions then move on to the basic of programming. 
  Foundation level programming constructs are addressed early in the class and include decision making (conditional flow control) and iteration (loops). The class focuses largely on procedural programming in the first semester and leaves details of functionalisation and object-oriented programming to the second semester. 
  Throughout the class, the emphasis is strongly on problem solving such that the skills developed can be cross transferred to other languages.
