Course content 
 Year 1 
 Students learn about the fundamental principles and concepts of the following topics: 
  
  mathematics 
  mechanics 
  dynamics 
  thermodynamics & fluid mechanics 
  electrical engineering 
  
 Engineering science content is integrated through the Design and Application classes. An introduction to Aeronautical Engineering is included through elective classes. 
 Year 2 
 You'll focus on the mainstream core of engineering subjects, together with Applied Mathematics and Information Technology. There are also further elective class options covering aeronautical engineering or business management. At the end of Year 2 you will complete a hands-on flight experience field course at a gliding school. 
 Year 3 
 In third-year, we introduce you to various aeronautical topics, such as flight mechanics, spaceflight dynamics and aerodynamics, in parallel with the Mechanical Engineering core. You will also learn about the design and manufacture of a remote-control scale aircraft and flight simulation studies. 
 Years 4 & 5 
 All students undertake a major aero-related individual project.
