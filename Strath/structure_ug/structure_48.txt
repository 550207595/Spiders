 Personal Development Planning (PDP)
 
   You normally have the same Personal Development Adviser (PDA) throughout your degree. PDP is an important part of learning and personal development. It's not only associated with your university course, it allows you to plan for the future. 
 
 Mathematics
 
   Aims to give a basic understanding of: 
   
   mathematical functions 
   differentiation 
   integration 
   complex numbers 
   matrices & vectors 
   
 
 Mechanics, Optics & Waves
 
   This class provides you with an understanding of motion of simple mechanical systems, gravitation and simple harmonic motion. You'll also learn about the fundamentals of wave propagation and the superposition of waves as well as simple optical phenomena such as diffraction. 
 
 Molecular Bioscience
  
  This class studies cellular structure and function and is concerned with the chemical basis of life and the fundamentals of cell biochemistry. The molecular basis of inheritance, human genetics, genes and the environment are also covered. 
     
     
 
 Year 2 
 Inorganic Chemistry
 
   This class aims to provide a broad knowledge of the important concepts in inorganic chemistry from which more specialist topics can be tackled. This includes investigation of the chemistry of the main group and transition metals and introduces topics at the forefront of inorganic and materials chemistry. 
 
 Fundamental Organic Chemistry
 
   This class covers the fundamental principles of infra-red, ultra-violet, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. It develops competence in the interpretation of spectra and your awareness of the role of spectroscopic techniques. It will also develop knowledge of reactions, understanding of mechanisms and appreciation of the role of reactivity in organic chemistry. 
 
 Physical Chemistry 1
  
  This class provides a broad knowledge of the important concepts in Thermodynamics, investigating the major features as applied to chemical systems. Topics include: 
   
   the importance of reaction rates in chemical systems 
   concepts of the electrode/solution interface 
   equilibrium and electron transfer kinetics 
   mass transport 
   the composition & utilisation of fossil fuels with their environmental pollutants 
   nuclear & renewable energy sources 
   
 
 Forensic Trace Analysis & Analytical Chemistry
 
   This class provides fundamental concepts of separation science and outlines its importance in obtaining information about analytes in a sample. Also covers the fundamental concepts of recovery of trace evidence and treatment of materials to provide identification. You're taught how to handle, examine and assess errors in chemical measurements. 
 
 Year 3 
 Study abroad
  
  Students have the option to spend third year studying abroad in a sister University in the European Union or the European Free Trade Area. 
  We're leading practitioners of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS), designed to simplify and facilitate the planning and recognition of periods of study in other universities. Additional EU funding under the ERASMUS programme may be available to some students each year to supplement their SAAS grants. There will also be opportunities to spend third year at one of the premier universities in the USA or in Canada, but you will have to find some money towards the costs. 
 
 Physical Chemistry 2
  
  This class provides an understanding of intermolecular forces and their importance in defining key aspects of chemical behaviour and molecular organization. It introduces: 
   
   surface chemistry and the common systems in which it plays a major role 
   the electronic structure of atoms and molecules through the prism of quantum chemistry 
   group theory and how it can be applied to the determination of the symmetry of molecules and their properties 
   the principles of bonding in molecules as described by valence bond and molecular orbital theories 
   
 
 Practical Organic & Inorganic Chemistry
 
   In this class you'll receive a practical demonstration of topics contained in the lectures. You'll develop basic laboratory skills in preparative chemistry and analysis, and gain experience in the applications of spectroscopy and common instrumental techniques.

 Intermediate Organic Chemistry & Spectroscopy
  
  This class teaches modern NMR spectroscopy as it is applied to chemistry. It covers: 
   
   skills for handling and interpreting NMR data for the purposes of chemical structure elucidation 
   theoretical basis of the NMR experiment using the vector formalism 
   reactivities of organic molecules 
   organic syntheses using the disconnection approach 
   synthesis and reactivities of electron-poor and electron-rich heterocyclic molecules 
   
  It provides an insight into the role of computational chemistry in chemical research and training in the use of modern computational chemistry software. 
 
 Inorganic Chemistry, Structures & Spectroscopy
 
   This class provides a more advanced view of main group and transition metal coordination and organometallic chemistry. Themes to be covered include ligands and their influence on complexes, trends in structure and bonding, stereochemistry, reactivity, and the application of spectroscopic and other methods of identification. Also modern spectroscopy as it is applied in chemistry. 
 
 Practical Physical, Applied, Forensic & Analytical Chemistry
 
   You'll conduct experiments and gain practical experience of the theoretical aspects covered in lectures. You'll develop skills in: the demonstration of physical chemical principles; observation; the use of statistical methods; interpretation of data and the writing of laboratory and court reports. 
 
 Practical Physical, Applied & Drug Discovery Chemistry
  
  You'll conduct experiments in physical and applied chemistry and in chemistry relating to drug discovery, gaining practical experience of theoretic aspects of physical, applied and synthetic medicinal chemistry covered in lectures. 
  You'll develop laboratory skills, and skills in: physical chemistry and analytical observation; the use of statistical methods; synthetic medicinal chemistry and analysis; applications of spectroscopy and common instrumental techniques; and the writing of laboratory reports.

 Analytical Chemistry & Drugs of Abuse
  
  This class covers the fundamental analytical methods and advanced theories in chromatography, mass spectrometry and electroseparations. 
  It introduces the concept of experimental design and its application in analytical, forensic and preparative chemistry, and how to perform analytical calculations and interpret data. The analytical procedures used to identify substances controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001, the Medicines Act 1968 and the World Anti-Doping Agency. 
  You're introduced to methods of clandestine synthesis and how drug profiling can identify the synthetic route used. The pharmacology of drugs of abuse and the various biological matrices used in drug screening will also be described.
