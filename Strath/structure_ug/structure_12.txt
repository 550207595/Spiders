Course content 
 Year 1 
 Students learn about the fundamental principles and concepts of the following topics: 
  
  maths 
  mechanics 
  dynamics 
  thermodynamics & fluid mechanics 
  electrical engineering 
  
 Engineering science content is integrated through the Design and Application classes. An introduction to Aeronautical Engineering is included through an elective classes. 
 Year 2 
 You'll focus on the mainstream core of engineering subjects, together with Applied Mathematics & Information Technology. There are also further elective class options covering aeronautical engineering or business management. At the end of Year 2 you will complete a hands-on flight experience field course at a gliding school. 
 Year 3 
 In third-year, we introduce students to various aeronautical topics, such as flight mechanics, space-flight dynamics and aerodynamics, in parallel with the Mechanical Engineering core. You will also learn about the design and manufacture of a remote-control scale aircraft and flight simulation studies. 
 Year 4 
 All students undertake a major aero-related individual project.
