  We introduce models that emphasise the importance of the openness and consider how this impacts on policy. We also look at the determinants of levels and flows into and out of employment, unemployment and of the rate of inflation. We consider explanations for countries' differing unemployment/inflation experiences, and discuss the scope and limitations of monetary and fiscal policy. Finally, we develop models that aim to explain differences in countries' standards of living and develop models that focus on the determination of long-term growth. We contrast exogenous and endogenous growth models and discuss their policy implications.

It'll develop your skills in performing detailed analysis of the performance of numerical methods and will continue to develop your skills in the implementation of numerical algorithms using R. 
 
 Stochastics & Financial Econometrics
  
  You'll  be introduced to the basic concepts of random phenomena evolving in time, from two complementary points of view: probabilistic modelling and data-driven analysis.

In both cases, in addition to theoretical analysis, appropriate computational algorithms are introduced. The first half of the class introduces general modelling and simulation tools, and the second half focuses on the specific application of valuing financial derivatives, including the celebrated Black-Scholes theory.

  You'll also be able to describe, through various examples and techniques, how macroscopic properties of systems arise from the ensemble action of many microscopic ingredients, and, specifically, how deterministic 'laws' may arise from basic randomness of a system with many variables or degrees of freedom. Fundamental examples include Brownian motion and the ideal gas.

 Microeconomics 4
  
  Understanding modern game-theoretic methods in Microeconomics is a fundamental skill for economists. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to these methods. After studying the basic components of game theoretic reasoning using several instructive examples, we progress to study applications of the theory. We'll cover topics in cooperative and non-cooperative game theory and information problems.   
  This class is intended to show how game theory can be used to analyse strategic interaction in very diverse settings. In particular, it will be applied to economic and business problems including decision problems confronted by firms, employers, unions and governments, and also footballers and partygoers. 
  This course is useful in enhancing studentsâ understanding of other modules and will be of particular use in studentsâ dissertations. Students will gain key skills in strategic thinking that will be useful both in further study and employment. 
 
 Macroeconomics 4 EC404
  
  This class aims to provide students with an understanding of certain recent developments in macroeconomic theory, including modern theories of economic growth, real-business-cycles, unemployment, consumer expenditure and investment. 
  Macroeconomics is both a theoretical and empirical subject, so the presentation of theories is supplemented with examples of relevant empirical work (presented at a fairly intuitive level) to illustrate some of the ways that macroeconomic theories can be applied and tested. This should be of particular use in studentsâ dissertations. 
 
 Industrial Economics EC412
  
  This course will investigate the actions firms can take in markets with the aim of maintaining their market power by deterring entry of additional firms. A modern approach recognises that each firm faces competing firms who all have similar motives. 
  After briefly reviewing industry market structures to provide the basis of the analysis, issues of entry deterrence will be considered, including the role of advertising, issues associated with research and development, anti-trust and both vertical integration and horizontal mergers. The course will conclude with an investigation of regulatory measures that can be put in place to limit anti-competitive strategies, and consider the role of competition policy.
