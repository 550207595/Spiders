 Year 3 
 Governance & Accounting Ethics
  
  Governance issues have been debated at great length for many years, but have reach particular prominence in the aftermath of many of the major business scandals that have arisen since the 1990s. The publication of the Cadbury Report (since revised and repackaged as the UK Code on Corporate Governance) and the changes that have occurred on an international basis make it desirable to present the accounting aspects of governance and the study of ethics in an accounting setting as a separate class. This class is intended to provide an overview of the role of accounting within business and society more generally. 
 
 Auditing & Assurance
  
  
   This class aims to develop an appreciation of both the difficulties faced by preparers, auditors and standard setters in ensuring that a set of accounts gives a true and fair view and to develop an awareness of the extent to which academic research can guide and illuminate this process. It does this through the systematic analysis of auditing regulations and practical applications, in a context of institutional and cultural factors, and through exploring research into aspects of auditing, with a view to analysing the policy issues facing those who regulate and those who apply audit.

 Integrative Studies in Management Accounting
  
  This class will introduce students to a range of case situations which simulate real-world decision-making contexts. It aims to integrate and deepen the accounting knowledge derived from earlier accounting courses and independent research by applying the knowledge gained to a number of case studies. An important aspect of this class is for the students to reflect upon and develop their problem solving methodology. 
  All organisations have systems in place to plan and control. Planning and controlling is often regarded as an integral part of the management accounting function within these organisations. Planning and controlling activities can take many different forms in different organisations. This class through the use of case studies will illustrate these different manifestations and allow the student to develop methods of evaluating and analysing the appropriateness of different systems to different organisational contexts. 
 
 Sustainable Accounting: Theory & Practice
  
  This class deals with the impact on accounting of the emerging topic of sustainability. Sustainable development has been accepted as the goal of society. Sustainable development will require a major restructuring of almost all of our human activities including accounting. The accountancy profession will be faced with the challenge of accounting for sustainability. Professional accounting bodies, academics and practitioners alike are reviewing the implications of sustainability for business and accountancy. This class will deal with this emerging and highly relevant topic. 
  The Accounting Honours programme is designed to enable a deeper approach to learning, developing studentsâ€™ analytical, evaluation and synthesing skills. This new class with its innovative mix of learning techniques applied to a developing and socially relevant aspect of accounting is consistent with the aims and objectives of the honours programme. 
  This class is designed to prepare students to take an active part in the development of accountingâ€™s response to the sustainability agenda. It introduces students to the key elements of sustainable development and then explores the potential impacts on accounting from changing social and environmental pressures. Students will develop a theoretical and conceptual framework to evaluate the effectiveness of sustainable accounting. 
 
 Taxation
  
 
 Contemporary Issues in International Financial Reporting
  
  This class will discuss selected topics in the preparation of financial statements for external publication. The subjects selected will be issues that provide an opportunity to explore various parts of the regulation of financial reporting and the associated accounting choices implied by such regulations. The class will include a significant coverage of contemporary issues which have been of interest both to the accountancy profession and to society in recent years. This is an advanced level class in financial accounting. It discusses complex issues at both a practical and a theoretical level. By the time that students complete this class they should have an appreciation of both the difficulties faced by preparers, auditors and standard setters in ensuring that a set of accounts gives a true and fair view and also an awareness of the extent to which academic research can guide and illuminate this process.   
 
 Management Accounting: Theory & Practice
  
 
 Research Methodologies & Accounting
  
  This class explores the main methodological approaches to researching accounting institutions, processes, practices and knowledge. Understanding the range of different methodologies is a key to interpreting, analysing and critically engaging with the research literature. Accounting research does not have a uniform methodological foundation. The diversity of accounting research methodologies provides a rich and varied literature but which can be difficult to understand without a grounding in research philosophy and methodology. 
  This class contributes to the following aims of the honours year: 
   
   to activate and encourage a deeper approach to the learning process 
   to offer a meaningful interaction with the external environment and 
   to allow the construction of intellectual, social and practical contexts in which students may locate their knowledge and understanding of accountancy 
   It achieves this through its provision of systematic instruction in social science research methodology and research methods and through exploring their use with a range of accounting research questions.
   
 
 Public Sector Accounting
  
  The public and third sector is a significant part of the governance of all aspects of life, particularly in developed economies, and plays a major part in the UK economy. Accounting is a critical part of the provision of public services and governance and is often overlooked in accounting degree programmes. Public service accountability is substantively different than for profit-enterprises and creates very different problems and challenges for accounting and assurance practices and this class will address these problems and challenges. 
  The aims of this class are to explore theoretical and philosophical foundations of public service accounting, auditing and accountability, developing a conceptual framework with which to evaluate contemporary public service organization accounting processes and practices. This class considers the whole accounting â€˜life cycleâ€™ from strategy, policy development, budgeting, performance measurement, reporting and assurance, integrating the main accounting processes and practices in the public service field. 
 
 Accounting & Risk
  
  Risk and risk management is the basis of many accounting techniques. Financial reporting was introduced to protect investors from the actions of bad or incompetent managers. Financial auditing was introduced to further enhance this risk management tool. Many business decisions are about balancing risks â€“ for example decisions to insure or not to insure, what level of investment in safety equipment, to hedge against currency or interest rate movements. Accounting can be viewed as a desire to reduce risks. 
  Over the past few years new theories of risk have been emerging that question our understanding of risk and the way in which risk is factored into organisational and individual decision-making. These new theories question the applicability of objective risk and probability theories used in finance and accounting. The consequences of these theories have the potential to radically alter many accounting conventions and basic techniques. This class explores these potential consequences. This class will explore the emerging risk debate by introducing the students to a new literature base and consider the impact on accounting from this new risk perspective. Existing techniques will be deconstructed using risk theories and new ways of accounting for risk explored. Students will develop an enhanced risk framework offering new insights into existing problems and phenomena. 
 
 Auditing Theory & Practice
  
  This class will discuss the nature and purpose of the external audit of financial statements through an examination of the formal institutional framework (the work of the International Federation of Accountants), the informal framework (the Big Four audit firms) and the processes underlying the collection of audit evidence and reporting of results. 
  It'll adopt the perspective of the institutions and participants in the audit process themselves. This will require an agency-based approach to the discipline. While the limitations of this approach will be addressed in the passing, it's intended that students will see this class as a counterpoint to the more rigorous and theoretically motivated classes that are presently offered in the honours programme. 
 
 Accounting Ethics
  
  This class will discuss the nature of ethics and the manner in which ethical dilemmas can be identified and resolved. It'll explore a number of specific themes that can be used to clarify the nature of ethical dilemmas affecting accountants. These will include aspects of financial accounting, (the pressures associated with creative accounting) auditing, (the need to report findings honestly), management accounting (the implications of setting unattainable budgets), and taxation (the extent to which tax avoidance can be justified). 
  It'll provide students with a set of techniques with which to explore the dilemmas that will be introduced. These are necessarily philosophical in nature and cannot be regarded as objective or beyond challenge, but they do offer the means to subject a course of action to a rigorous analysis.   
 
 Accounting Theories
  
  This class offers an advanced course on the historic foundations of, and contemporary theoretical issues in, accounting. It builds upon a number of year 3 courses, in particular, Advanced Financial Accounting and Financial Analysis. 
 
 Corporate Governance
  
  This class will explore aspects of governance, examining both the institutions and structures that are in place to reassure stakeholders and also the underlying agency and economic forces that shape governance practices. Corporate governance will be explored through each of the aspects identified by standard setters as important in this area, namely: â€¢ the principles of sound leadership from the board of directors
  â€¢ developing the boardâ€™s effectiveness
  â€¢ promoting accountability though external financial reporting
  â€¢ designing a board remuneration strategy that aims to align the interests of shareholders with directors
  â€¢ maintaining sound relations with shareholders 
  Each of these topics can be explored from a variety of perspectives. For example, the question of accountability can be analysed from a philosophical perspective or through the analysis of stock market reactions to disclosures. 
 
 Strategic Accounting & Financial Management in Entrepreneurial Firms
  
  This class covers the areas of accounting and financial management in entrepreneurial firms, with an emphasis on strategic planning in the early start-up phase. It'll provide theoretical background and practical insight into the financial implications of setting up and running a new small business. It'll apply learning from early stages in the degree, in particular building upon courses which cover cost accounting and management decision making and control. It'll provide students with insight into the role played by management accountants and financial managers within the wider organisation, and will draw on skills learned throughout the BA degree. The aim of this class is to enable students to develop their theoretical understanding of the financial managerâ€™s and accountantâ€™s roles in business and to put into practice this newly-acquired knowledge.   
 
 Understanding Accounting Technologies & Institutional Structures
  
  This class is concerned with the use of various social theories in the interrogation of the accounting profession and accounting practice. It begins with a general introduction to social theories in accounting in order to situate the different theoretical perspectives in relationship to each other. It then takes several modern and postmodern theoretical frameworks to evaluate the insights they may or may not offer to accounting practice, practitioners and students. Different historical methods are then developed and critiqued. The end section of the class reconfirms the importance of history and the lessons we can learn from it. The theoretical theme running throughout the class is based upon the 'linguistic-turn' in its various theoretical forms (ideology, discourse, semiotics and so on).
