Course content The part-time distance learning BEng/MEng courses are closely aligned with the full-time courses, featuring access to the same resources and materials alongside virtual webinars, video lectures and electronic forums. 
 Year 1 
 Mathematics Bridging for Chemical Engineering
  
  You'll learn how to solve the various kinds of mathematical equations that are necessary to progress in the course. In particular you'll focus on solving mathematical equations using the techniques of  differentiation, integration, complex number theory, Laplace transforms and ordinary differential equation  methods. 
 
 Fluid Flow & Heat Transfer
  
  The module will cover: 
   
   material and energy balances of systems involving fluids in motion 
   visualisation of fluid flow patterns and perform calculations on fluid flow in pipework 
   principles of fluid flow measurement 
   fluids in motion sufficient to determine the power requirements of different types of pumps and their applications 
   Fourierâ€™s Law for both plane and radial situations 
   standard convection equation, which includes the heat-transfer coefficient (h) 
   construction of the double-pipe heat exchanger for both co-current and counter current 
   flow paths in a multi-pass heat exchanger 
   simple condensers where a saturated vapour is the inlet flow, and a mixture of saturated vapour/liquid is the outlet flow 
   difference between boiling and evaporation 
   plate-and-frame and finned-tube heat exchangers 
   other cases of unsteady-state heat transfer 
   
 
 Chemical Engineering Principles & Thermodynamics
  
  ChemEng Principles 
  You'll learn to calculate molar quantities and flowrates commonly used in chemical engineering  environments. You'll learn how to calculate heats of reaction and apply the knowledge to elevated  temperatures. This knowledge will be applied to mass and energy balances for simple unit operations. 
  Thermodynamics 
  You'll learn how thermodynamics underpins many chemical engineering classes as well as domestic  phenomena and societal issues. The principles will be developed firstly with single-component systems followed  by binary systems. 
 
 Chemical Engineering Safety
  
  This module will cover: 
   
   introduction to Hazard Identification and Quantification as applicable to process plant 
   HAZOP 
   fault/event outcome trees 
   emission 
   dispersion 
   fires/radiation 
   blast and effects 
   risk assessment & consequence analysis 
   industry standards and procedures for Permit to Work (as a procedure) 
   general legal  framework 
   toxicology and design for safety - including layout, relief systems, safety reviews (in general  terms) 
   
 
 Year 2 
 Process Analysis & Statistics
  
  This module aims to provide the essential skills for chemical engineers in analysing chemical and physical processes through  material and energy balances, and vapour/liquid behaviour, and to analyse process data using statistical techniques. 
 
 Mass Transfer & Separation Processes
  
  The module will teach the following: 
   
   material and energy balances for separation processes 
   binary fluid vapour-liquid equilibria including construction of x-y diagrams 
   principles of mass transfer (diffusion, including diffusion through varying cross-sectional area and path length, and across a vapour-liquid interface 
   principles of binary distillation in staged and packed towers, including the McCabe-Thiele model and batch processes 
   principles of gas absorption and stripping in staged and packed towers 
   an introduction to evaporator processes 
   gas adsorption in porous materials, including basic thermodynamics of adsorption, gas-solid equilibria for pure gases, and the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory for mixed gases 
   introduction to gas adsorption processes and scale-up 
   
 
 Process Design & Simulation
  
  This module aims to build your competence in the analysis of existing processes and preliminary process design. An  element of the module involves the use of computer packages for the purpose of process calculation and design. 
 
 Reactors & Economics
  
  This module aims to: 
   
   introduce basic economic theory such as supply and demand curves, marginal revenue and costs, and economic pricing 
   describe the basic structures in which a business can operate and sources of finance 
   explain the need for cash flow control and introduce the effects that taxation can have on business operations 
   describe methods of cost estimation and project evaluation 
   
 
 Year 3 
 Process Control & Environmental Technology
  
  This modules aims to introduce you to: 
   
   the basic principles of water pollution, waste water treatment and effluent treatment plant design 
   the basic principles of air pollution and air pollution control technology 
   process control 
   
 
 Advanced Separations & Particle Technology
  
  Advanced Separations 
  This module aims to instil in students the principles of advanced unit processes relating to separation: multicomponent distillation, membrane technology and drying. 
  Particle Technology 
  This module aims to develop understanding of key issues related to particle formation processes and products involving particulate systems. 
 
 Chemical Engineering Design
  
  This module aims to allow you to apply your knowledge to more practical and less well-defined situations. You'll have the opportunity to gain experience in considering a process as an overall entity rather than just a series of different unit operations.
