Course content 
 Year 1 
 Compulsory classes 
 Engineering Mechanics 1 
 
   A study of mechanics gives you the basic tools to understand how the world, both natural and man-made. 
  
   You come to Engineering Mechanics with an elementary understanding of the basic principles of mechanics acquired from introductory school physics together with their application to problem solving. This class places more emphasis on the basic skills required to start to apply these concepts and principles to real engineering problem solving. The class focuses on the practice of these skills, rather than factual content. In this class doing required background reading, coming to class and doing homework are like practising for a football team. The tutor/lecturer is less a source of information and more of a coach who structures practice and sets standards. Studentsâ€™ progress not by absorbing (and regurgitating) information but rather by practising their skills individually and learning to work effectively with others.
