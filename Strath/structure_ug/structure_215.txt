 Year 2 
 Design 2
 
   The aim of this class is to provide continuation of the first year classes, oncentrating on techniques appropriate to different phases of the design process including user centred research, conceptual, embodiment and detailed design. 
 
 Design and Manufacturing Management
 
   This class aims to provide you with an understanding of the key issues faced by design and project managers in the design and development of new products and services. The class also provides an understanding of the key issues faced by design and manufacturing managers and an awareness of the systematic approaches available for the design and layout of manufacturing systems. 
 
 Integrating Studies 2
 
   This class aims to develop the your ability to create appropriate functional prototypes for the purposes of mechanical design and visualisation. To engender an appreciation of different prototyping methods and their application areas. 
 
 Production Techniques 1
 
   This class aims to increase the depth of production technology knowledge gained in the first year Introduction to Production and Engineering Management class. It introduces you to primary processes for metal and polymer production, metal cutting theory, secondary manufacturing processes, engineering metrology, and the manufacture of electronic components and products. 
 
 Year 3 
 Integrating Studies 3
 
   This class aims to develop design and manufacturing project based skills relevant to each of the four undergraduate degree courses, and to provide practice in the application of engineering, manufacture and design principles. 
 
 Product Development
 
   This methods based class aims to develop and enhance your knowledge of the issues, concepts, methodologies and methods involved in product design and development. 
 
 Production Techniques 2
 
   This class aims to provide you with a knowledge and understanding of modern and non-traditional manufacturing techniques and with the ability to apply this knowledge to the design of tooling and the selection of the appropriate manufacturing techniques for creating components and products. It also aims to provide you with an understanding of the role of manufacturing processes in converting advanced materials into products, and the ability to carry out computer simulations of some of the primary processes. 
 
 Mechatronics Design & Applications
 
   This class aims to provide you with an understanding of the fundamental concepts and methods of mechatronic system design and applications including those in manufacturing industry. 
 
 Elective classes
  
  You can choose from:   
   
   Design Emotion & Experience 
   Design Interaction 
   Innovation Management 
   Production & Operations Management

 Year 4 
 Advanced Design Methods
 
   This class builds upon the knowledge of Design Methods acquired in DM306. It'll develop knowledge and understanding of the integration, development and application of design methods.   This is in the areas of design for manufacture and assembly, sustainability, cost and design for Xs at embodiement and detail design level. 
 
 Advanced Product Design & Manufacture
 
   This class aims to introduce design and manufacturing techniques and systems at an advanced level. It enables you to understand the application of advanced product design engineering and manufacturing techniques/systems in product development (in particular in mechatronic systems). This includes developing manufacturing plans for product realisation. It provides opportunities for you to develop technology focused products/systems within the class supervised environment as well as to generate plans for the manufacture of these products/systems for volume production. 
 
 Individual Project 1
 
   This class aims to consolidate and develop experience in undertaking a major individual project and develop a good appreciation of professional practice by utilising design, manufacturing and management knowledge acquired during the course and applying it to real life situations. You're  to create a working prototype and  demonstrate knowledge of specific course related expertise. 
 
 Industrial Group Project 1
 
   This class aims to integrate and apply design, manufacturing and management knowledge and skills, acquired in previous years of the course, to an industry based product development project and to develop team project skills. 
 
 Quality Management
 
   This class aims to equip you with a critical understanding of Quality Management and Control principles, concepts, tools and techniques. The class also aims to introduce you to statistically plan, design and execute industrial experiments for process understanding and improvement in both manufacturing and service environments.
