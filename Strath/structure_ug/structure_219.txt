You'll gain knowledge of the basic and advanced clinical and technical requirements of becoming a competent and professional practitioner. 
  Cross-curricular, sequential links with other relevant and complementary modules will be established, e.g. human biological sciences, professional skills for healthcare, principles of prosthetic and orthotic design, and health services research. 
 
 Elective Class
  
  You'll take an elective class of your own choice. 
 
 Year 3 
 Human Biological Science 3
  
  This class will provide knowledge of the structure and functioning of skeletal muscle tissue. The effects of exercise on the respiratory, cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems will be considered. 
  You'll develop an understanding of the pathophysiological changes underlying conditions affecting locomotion. Selected pathologies of particular relevance to prosthetic and orthotic practice will be covered in depth, including stroke, diabetes and contractures. 
 
 Principles of Prosthetic and Orthotic Design 3
  
  The aim of this class is to develop your skills to recognise and respond to the trends that shape prosthetics & orthotics. 
 
 Prosthetics and Orthotic Science 3 with Applied Health Service Research
  
  This class aims to give you the knowledge and practical application of: 
   
   Upper Limb Prosthetics and Orthotics (all levels) 
   Spinal Orthotics (all levels) 
   Case Studies (assessing complex multi-level patients) 
   Applied Health Services Research (statistics, research ethics and research methodology) 
   
 
 Prosthetics/Orthotics Clinical Placement
  
  Students in years 3 & 4 are required to undertake two periods of clinical placement; one in prosthetics and one in orthotics. 
  Each placement is for a minimum of 4 months. You're placed in approved clinical facilities under the direction of a designated supervisor.
