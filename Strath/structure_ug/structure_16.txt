 Year 2 
 Compulsory classes 
 Introduction to Infection & Immunity
  
  This class will provide you with an introduction to the diversity of infectious agents and how the immune response of the mammalian host attempts to clear infection. 
  Lectures will cover aspects of bacterial, parasitic, viral and fungal infections, describing pathogens, the diseases they cause and mechanisms of control. Lectures will also describe many of the key components of the immune system, before examining how these factors play a role in mediating defence against different infections. 
 
 Nutritional Biochemistry & Metabolism
  
  The aims of this class are to: 
   
   To demonstrate the general principles of the design of metabolism, the way in which major pathways are integrated and regulated through signal transduction and the role of metabolism in nutrition 
   To provide a biochemical basis for understanding inborn errors of metabolism and metabolism in disease states   
   To demonstrate the role of enzymes in controlling metabolic pathways 
   
 
 Cell & Molecular Biology
  
  The aims of this class are: 
   
   To demonstrate the role of genetic analysis in the elucidation of the mechanisms of gene function 
   To provide an introduction to cytology and histology 
   To develop a deeper understanding of cellular compartments and structures and their functions   
   
 
 Practical Bioscience & Skills Development 2
  
  The aims of this class are: 
   
   To develop skills for laboratory work in Biomedical Sciences 
   To reinforce understanding of key principles of core subjects taught in 2nd year 
   To enable you to analyse your personal and key skills and plan your development 
   To introduce you to the type of analytic methods used in the different degree disciplines ie Biomedical Science, Biochemistry, Forensic Biology, Immunology, Microbiology and Pharmacology 
   
 
 Human Physiology
  
  This class will provide you with a working knowledge of normal human physiology in preparation for the study of human diseases and the uses of drugs in their treatment. 
 
 Bio-organic Chemistry
  
 
 Year 3
 
 All full-time students shall undertake the following compulsory classes along with a choice of elective classes.
  
 Compulsory classes 
 Laboratory Methods & Skills Development
  
  This class will  familiarise you with the current laboratory methods utilised in biomedical science research by attending laboratory sessions intended to provide a wide range of generic skills expected of laboratory science. 
  You'll also be trained in data collation and presentation and be able to write reports in a coherent and scientific manner. It's also intended that you'll gain an understanding of the underlying design of experimental studies.   
 
 Clinical Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics
  
  With its distinct molecular and clinical components, the class has a broad scope that is united by its focus on our modern understanding of human genetic disorders and their diagnosis and treatment. 
  The study of diseases and disorders from both the frontiers of basic molecular, cellular and pre-clinical research as well as the ‘frontline’ of hospital diagnostic procedures gives you a feel for the breadth of biomedical research and practice. 
  The clinical biochemistry section also provides a detailed overview of the physiologies and pathologies of major organ diseases and disorders affecting Western populations in the 21st Century. 
  The exposure to clinical expertise from external Glasgow Royal Infirmary lecturers is an important feature. 
  Finally, as a complementary part of the Clinical Biochemistry section, the major biochemical steps in drug metabolism are described. 
 
 Proteins & Enzymes 
  
  This class will give you an appreciation of: 
   
   the key role of enzymes and other proteins in the living cell 
   how proteins work and how their function depends on their chemical structure and properties 
   
 
 Year 4
 
 All full-time students shall undertake the following compulsory classes along with a choice of elective classes.
  
 Compulsory classes
