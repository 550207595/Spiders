 Learning & teaching 
 The course is delivered through lectures, tutorials and hands-on practical sessions. 
 You'll have around 240 hours of lectures, tutorials and labs per year in Years 1 to 3. In your Honours year, you'll carry out a research project in one of your specialisations and write this up as a short thesis. 
 If you successfully complete the required taught classes you may undertake a laboratory project for the MSc.
