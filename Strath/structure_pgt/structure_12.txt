 Industrial Pharmacy
 
   The aim of the class is to give advanced information on standard organics with highlighting the challenges on Biopharmaceuticals aspects in relation to drug development. 
 
 Process Analytical Technology & Quality by Design in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
  
 
 Continuous Manufacturing of Pharmaceutical Particles & Products
 
   This class aims to provide you with direct experience of continuous crystallisation and downstream processes. You'll have the opportunity to apply the underpinning knowledge gained from proceeding classes to manufacture a pharmaceutical product using continuous processes. 
 
 Crystallisation & Formulation for Manufacture
 
   The aim is to provide academic and practical training in drug and fine chemical crystallisation principles and the subsequent formulation and processing requirements to produce medicinal and consumer products. 
 
 Pharmaceutical Project Management
 
   The aim of this class is to impart knowledge and understanding of the Pharmaceutical Project management keeping in view of pharmaceutical, biotech and industry in mind. 
  
 MSc only 
 Continuous Manufacturing Research Project
 
   You'll undertake an assignment usually in one of the continuous manufacturing and crystallisation research laboratories where they undertake a project and prepare a thesis for assessment. 
  
 Learning & teaching 
 Theory and applications are taught through lectures, tutorials, seminars and web-based learning. Class material is available through an online learning tool which you can access at any time. 
 Youâ€™ll also take part in practical sessions which provide you with experience of a wide range of modern instrumental and state-of-the-art techniques.
