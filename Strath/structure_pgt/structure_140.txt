 Semester 1 
 Human Development & Functioning
  
  This module examines the impact of diverse social contexts on human growth, development and behaviour. 
 
 The Context of Social Work
  
  We explore the historical, societal, legal and structural (including social policy) context of social work service provision. 
 
 Social Work Theory & Practice 1
  
  This is the foundation module for exploring the values issues and developing the knowledge and skills base required for the sustained placement in a social work agency. 
  
 Semester 2 
 Professional Practice 1
  
  This module consists of a formally supported and assessed placement of 85 days in one of a range of social work service settings. These include:

   groupwork projects 
   criminal justice settings 
   hospitals and other health settings 
   residential and day care centres 
   specialist service centres in the community

  You may be required to work unsocial hours and shift patterns to accommodate the needs of service users. Placements are to be found in both local authority and the independent sectors. 
 
 Year 2 
 Semester 1 
 Harm, Risk, Care & Protection
  
  This module critically examines the concepts of risk and protection. It explores how social work services seek to balance the often competing objectives of managing risk effectively while promoting peoples' rights to independence and autonomy. 
 
 The Organisational Context
  
  You’ll look at the impact of social workers' agency context on workers and services and consider strategies designed to promote effectiveness in service provision. 
 
 Social Work Theory & Practice 2
  
  This builds on the earlier modules around practice preparation and seeks to develop a wider repertoire of approaches and methods.

 Learning & teaching 
 The teaching and learning approach is student-centred and aims to promote reflective learning. Our key approach is problem-based learning which is universally recognised as an effective way of developing the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed by busy professionals. 
 The course is taught through lectures, seminar groups, simulations and individual skills rehearsal with a commitment to use interactive e-learning wherever relevant. At the heart of the course is practice learning in social work service agencies with formally assessed placements being undertaken in both years.
