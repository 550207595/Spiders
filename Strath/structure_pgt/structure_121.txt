 Introduction to Philosophy & Philosophical Practice
 
   This class offers an introduction to the philosophy and logic that a facilitator of Philosophy with Children will require. It also provides opportunities for you to take part in philosophical dialogue at your own level. 
 
 Philosophy with Children Theory
 
   In this class you’ll be introduced to different approaches to practical philosophy. You’ll learn how to:
   
   
   choose stimulus material 
   select appropriate questions to generate philosophical dialogue 
   analyse dialogue 
   
 
 Philosophy with Children Facilitation
 
   This class gives you the opportunity to bring together your learning in the previous two classes. You’ll undertake facilitation of Community of Philosophical Inquiry. 
  
 Learning & teaching 
 This course involves a lot of student participation.   Module one includes some interactive lecture input as well as philosophical dialogue.   Modules two and three will be more tutorial-based with some more formal lecture input but participative groupwork is used throughout. 
 Guest lectures 
 We try to invite speakers who will be of interest to students.   Dr. Catherine McCall, who worked with Matthew Lipman and who brought Philosophy with Children to Scotland, is a guest speaker, as are class teachers with relevant experience of Philosophy with Children.
