 Client-Based Environmental Entrepreneurship In Practice 
  
  This class is a client-based project work, where you work in a small group and carry out a project of interest to a client while at the same contributing to environmental entrepreneurship in practice. 
  The potential projects are identified by outside organisations and the class manager during initial meetings. The aims of each project are defined in terms of progressive risks in effecting a solution. The first aim has a high chance of success and low risk of failure; the second aim is more challenging but capable of solution given initiative and energy on the part of the students; and the third aim can have a 'blue skies' element, a real research challenge and consequently a high risk of failure but success will demonstrate exceptional competence and initiative. The class manager and the head of the department select and approve all the final chosen project topics, and allocate them to the student groups. The project has a four-month duration and is carried out between January and April.
