Course content All four classes are compulsory unless you can provide evidence of prior learning. In those circumstances, in consultation with the programme leader, you'll study three out of four compulsory classes. 
 Year 1 
 Semester 1 
 Greek Theatre to the National Theatre of Scotland
  
  This class is designed to first introduce stage-centred dramatic criticism with theory and performance being given equal value. It then develops and examines the evolution of theatre representation from Classism to Expressionism. 
  
 Semester 2 
 Directing in the Theatre
  
  The syllabus of the class is designed to first introduce and consider theatre as an event including its independence from the dramatic text (Sauter, 2000). It then develops and examines the theatrical event and resultant collective tension of an audience. 
 
 Year 2 
 Semester 1 
 Dramatic Work in Production
  
  The class is designed to develop your experience of the totality of the theatrical performance including spatial organisation as defined by Edward T. Hall (1966) and the pursuit of the ‘shared illusion’ (Brook, 1968). The class then develops and examines the emotional shift of performers in rehearsal. 
  
 Semester 2 
 Studio Theatre Production
  
  The syllabus of the class is designed to develop your understanding and experience of a broad set of theatrical practices and to select a text-based or devised work and stage this for an invited audience. Focus will be on the unity of stage and audience. 
  
 Learning & teaching 
 Module delivery will combine seminar presentation and discussion with workshop activities. You'll be encouraged to critically analyse and respond creatively to the tasks set. Audio-visual material and internet sources will be integral to the workshop sessions with key reading and workshop themes distributed at the start of the programme.
