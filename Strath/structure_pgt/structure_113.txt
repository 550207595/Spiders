Course content 
 Compulsory classes 
 Research Skills
  
  This course introduces core skills needed to obtain research funding and successfully manage the resulting research in both an academic and a commercial environment. 
 
 Project Training
  
  This course develops your transferable skills (communication skills, literature survey)﻿  in preparation for the project undertaken on the course. 
  It also helps you in developing an understanding of the management of projects in an industrial setting and preparation for successful working in technological industries. 
 
 Project
  
  You'll undertake a cutting edge research project in either one of the research groups of the Department of Physics or with collaborating departments and institutions (Chemistry, Institute of Photonics, Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics, Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Centre for Biophotonics). 
 
 Introductionary Nanoscience
  
  The course addresses basic concepts relating to nanoscale physics before progressing to the techniques associated with production and characterisation of nanomaterials/nanostructures, and their potential impact in engineering, energy and healthcare. 
 
 Conversion Course
  
  This provides participants with a strong knowledge base from which to tackle the rest of the syllabus. 
 
 Advanced Nanoscience 1: Imaging & Microscopy
  
  The aim of this course is to introduce the spectroscopy, imaging and microscopy techniques associated with modern nanoscience such as: 
   
   Fluorescence methods 
   Single molecule imaging and microscopic techniques 
   Atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
   Electron microscopy﻿ 
   
 
 Advanced Nanoscience 2: Solid State Nanoscience
  
  This course introduces advanced key concepts in modern nano-scale condensed matter physics and optics. 
  Modern computational methods to investigate these systems will then be introduced to illustrate methods of applying these concepts to realistic nanosystems. 
 
 Advanced Nanoscience 3: Chemical & Biomedical Nanoscience
  
  Aspects of chemical and biomedical nanoscience including nano-functionalisation and sensing and detection methods.
