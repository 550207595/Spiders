   make students aware of key aspects of current software engineering research 
   familiarise students with the state-of-the-art in terms of what problems can be solved and what are the current exciting challenges 
   develop the necessary skills in students to allow them to contribute to the software engineering research community 
   equip students with the skills and background to appreciate the contributions to software engineering research across the full range of material presented at the key international conferences in the field 
   
 
 Designing Usable Systems
  
  In this class, you'll develop research level understanding of the design of interfaces for newly emerging technologies and computing domains such as ubiquitous and mobile computing, universal access and collaborative displays. 
 
 Distributed Information Systems
  
  This class will give you an extended understanding of the deep, technical issues underlying information systems in the particular context of distributing content over the world-wide web. 
 
 Mobile Software & Applications
  
  You'll develop an understanding of the theories, paradigms, algorithms and architectures for building software applications to function in mobile computing environments. 
 
 Personal Study
  
  The aims of this class are to: 
   
   strengthen your self-study skills in technical material at the forefront of a specialism within your discipline 
   develop your abilities to identify, synthesise, abstract, connect and present materials within a specialist topic area of computer science 
   support you in bridging between your background knowledge within your selected specialism and the advanced materials required for subsequent study of the specialism within the later modules of the Advanced Computer Science degree 
   ensure you achieve a threshold level of competency to meet all prerequisites of your selected modules within the Advanced Computer Science degree 
   
 
 Research Methods
 
   This class provides you with an understanding of both quantitative and qualitative research processes and associated techniques, including the effective presentation of findings in accordance with the best principles of scholarship. 
 
 MSc students only 
 Dissertation
  
  MSc students prepare a dissertation of up to 20,000 words on an approved topic. 
  This takes the form of an individual project on an approved topic, which allows you to pursue an area of specific interest, providing scope for original thought, research and presentation. 
  
 Learning & teaching The course is taught through lectures, tutorials and practical laboratories.
