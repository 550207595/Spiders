 Fundamentals Of Lean Six Sigma
  
  The objective of this class is to introduce the participants to the principles of Lean Six Sigma thinking, tools and techniques of Lean Six Sigma and understand the wider implications of the broader strategic issues of organisation management and how they impact on continuous improvement programme. 
  On completion of the class you should be able to understand the theory and practical application of Lean Six Sigma methodologies within a holistic process improvement framework. This will enable their businesses to become more efficient, cost effective and much more profit oriented in todayâ€™s competitive marketplace. 
 
 Sustainable Product Design & Manufacturing
  
  One of the major challenges of modern industry is to address the need for sustainable product development and manufacturing. International legislation and increasing costs of fiscal instruments such as the landfill tax now aim to force producers to reduce the environmental impacts of their products and processes. Accelerating globalization and industrialization continues to exacerbate complexity of sustainability. Whilst manufacturers are constantly required to lower their costs and maintain their competitiveness, legislations require them to look at lifecycle costs. 
  This class addresses these global concerns by studying lifecycle considerations for a sustainable and profitable product development and manufacture. The latest environmental legislation will also be studied along with product development concepts and strategies that will enable industry to meet these increasingly severe competitive, environmental and legislative pressures. The associated practical, hands- on sessions maximize the usefulness of the skills acquired in real-life operational industry setting. 
 
 Systems Thinking & Modelling
 
   The objective of this class is to introduce you to the theories and principles behind systems thinking. The class will also introduce you to the methods, tools and techniques for modelling, analysing, improving and designing systems in a variety of organisations, including industrial, commercial and public sector. 
 
 Design Of Experiments For Process Optimisation
 
   This class aims to introduce you to how to statistically plan, design and execute industrial experiments for process understanding and improvement in both manufacturing and service environments.
