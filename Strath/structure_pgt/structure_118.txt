Course content 
 Compulsory classes 
 Research Skills
  
  This course introduces core skills needed to obtain research funding and successfully manage the resulting research in both an academic and a commercial environment. 
 
 Project Training
  
  This course develops your transferable skills (communication skills, literature survey)ï»¿  in preparation for the project undertaken on the course. 
  It also helps you in developing an understanding of the management of projects in an industrial setting and preparation for successful working in technological industries. 
 
 Project
  
  You'll undertake a cutting edge research project in either one of the research groups of the Department of Physics or with collaborating departments and institutions (Chemistry, Institute of Photonics, Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics, Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Centre for Biophotonics).
