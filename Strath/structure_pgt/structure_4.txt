 Compulsory classes 
 Personal Study
  
  The aims of this class are to: 
   
   strengthen your self-study skills in technical material at the forefront of a specialism within your discipline 
   develop your abilities to identify, synthesise, abstract, connect and present materials within a specialist topic area of computer science 
   support you in bridging between your background knowledge within your selected specialism and the advanced materials required for subsequent study of the specialism within the later modules of the Advanced Computer Science degree 
   ensure you achieve a threshold level of competency to meet all prerequisites of your selected modules within the Advanced Computer Science degree

 MSc students only 
 Dissertation
  
  MSc students prepare a dissertation of up to 20,000 words on an approved topic. 
  This takes the form of an individual project on an approved topic, which allows you to pursue an area of specific interest, providing scope for original thought, research and presentation. 
  
 Learning & teaching 
 The course is taught through lectures, tutorials and practical laboratories. Dissertation is by supervision.
