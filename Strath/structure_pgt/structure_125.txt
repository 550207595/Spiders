Course content 
 The modules studied in the MSc course are dependent on the needs of the individual student. This allows you to pick and choose modules to suit your own requirements and learning objectives. 
 You'll study six modules each in years 1 & 2. In year 3 you’ll have to complete a project. This will normally be undertaken in your workplace and will allow you to apply the knowledge learned in your first two years.    
 Modules 
 The modules are in either one or two of the following lists: 
 List A: Process Technology 
 List B: Chemical Technology 
 List C: Business, Management and IT 
 Each completed module provides 10 postgraduate credits.  ﻿To be classified as a Process Technology and Management MSc graduate you must complete 180 credits including: 
  
  a minimum of 60 credits from list A 
  a minimum of 30 credits from List C 
  a 60 credit project 
  
 In addition the majority of technology modules being counted towards a qualification must be from list A. 
 The module descriptions are intended as a guide only. Please be aware that although the general content and aim of the modules will remain the same, there may be changes to some content and assessment as the lecturer will be continually update and develop the modules. Modules may also become unavailable from time to time, either through staff changes, or lack of demand. You should read this in conjunction with the current course regulations and student handbook.
