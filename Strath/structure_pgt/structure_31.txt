Course content 
 Compulsory Classes
 For all MSc Civil Engineering students (including specialist streams) 
 Civil Engineering Design Projects
  
  This class includes a choice between two projects: a renewable energy project or an industrial port project. If you intend to take the industrial Port Project it’s advised that you also take the Structural Design option module CL977 in Semester 1. 
 
 Research Protocols for Science & Engineering
  
  The course will familiarise students with basic research methodology, including the use of scientific literature, quantitative and qualitative methods, the maintenance of laboratory notes and the use of scientific English. 
  Particular assistance is given on research techniques to prepare students for the dissertation/project stage of the course. 
 
 Compulsory classes
 
 For students undertaking MSc Civil Engineering with Structural Engineering & Project Management
  
 Advanced Structural Analysis & Design 
  
  This class examines the links between form, geometric shape, and structural performance and design. It deals with different ways of breaking up a continuum, and how this affects global structural properties, structural concepts and preliminary design methods that are used in tension structures, and deployable structures. 
  You’ll also look at the fundamental principles of composite structures.   
 
 Prestressed Concrete, Composite Materials & Structural Stability 
  
  The overall aim of the class is to provide you with strong skills in the structural behaviour, analysis and design of civil engineering structures. 
  You’ll gain an understanding of the fundamental principles of structural stability and become familiar with common types of bifurcation and buckling phenomena. This will allow you to formulate methods capable of dealing with geometrically non-linear structural behaviour. 
  You’ll also gain knowledge of structural behaviour structural systems commonly adapted by the construction industry including prestressed concrete and concrete-steel composite members.   
 
 Ground Improvement & Reinforcement 
  
  This class covers the principles and techniques of ground improvement and soil reinforcement. You’ll apply the appropriate design methods in various ground conditions including the use of computer-aided design. 
 
 Project Management
  
  This class will develop your skills in the use of engineering practices in project management.   The focus is on the effective and efficient use of resources.   Areas covered includes: 
   
   introduction to project management techniques and project control 
   basic aspects of project teams 
   project networks 
   procedural and graphical presentation techniques 
   introduction to contract law 
   project budgetary control 
   
 
 Compulsory classes
 For students undertaking MSc Civil Engineering with Geotechnical Engineering & Project Management 
 Rock Mechanics, Tunnelling & Groundwater 
  
  The class aims to provide you with an understanding of sub-surface geology and rock mechanics and its influence on the engineering design of slopes and tunnels. 
  You’ll gain an overview of groundwater flow through soil and rocks. You’ll be introduced to techniques for the in-situ measurement of permeability and methodologies for site investigation in dewatering projects.   
 
 Ground Improvement & Reinforcement
  
  This class covers the principles and techniques of ground improvement and soil reinforcement. You’ll apply the appropriate design methods in various ground conditions including the use of computer-aided design. 
 
 Slopes & Walls 
  
  This class aims to cover the design of geotechnical structures under ultimate conditions including slopes and retaining walls, based on Eurocode 7. 
  The syllabus covers these areas: 
   
   Introduction to geotechnical structures - slopes and embankments, shallow foundations, pile foundations, retaining walls 
   Stability Analysis of Geostructures 
   Earth Retaining Structures 
   Slope Stability 
   
 
 Project Management
  
  This class will develop your skills in the use of engineering practices in project management.   The focus is on the effective and efficient use of resources.   Areas covered includes: 
   
   introduction to project management techniques and project control 
   basic aspects of project teams 
   project networks 
   procedural and graphical presentation techniques 
   introduction to contract law 
   project budgetary control
