 Learning & teaching 
 Constructivist learning theory informs the approaches to learning and teaching on this course, in that you'll be encouraged to explore, challenge and build upon your already existing knowledge and experience. 
 Classes may involve a small amount of lecture-style content, but will be mostly dialogical. Discussions will often be based on interrogating relevant research, theory and social policy as it relates to your practice. One module will also involve the use of video recording to enhance your communication skills and reflective capacities.
